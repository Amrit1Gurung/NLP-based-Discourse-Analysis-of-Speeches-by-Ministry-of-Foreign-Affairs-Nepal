Address by Minister for Foreign Affairs Hon. Mr. Pradeep Kumar Gyawali at the 73rd anniversary of Nepal Council of World Affairs (NCWA)
Kathmandu, 1 March 2021
President of the Nepal Council of World Affairs,
Executive Board Members of the Council,
Excellencies,
Distinguished guests,
Ladies and gentlemen. 
I am delighted to be back to this forum once again.
I thank you Mr. President and Members of the Council for organizing this event and for having me here.
It is always a pleasure to be amongst a cross-section of personalities who have made contributions to Nepal’s foreign policy and international relations from their respective capacities.
I would like to acknowledge the role played by Nepal Council of World Affairs in promoting healthy discourse on matters related to Nepal’s foreign policy as well as on topics of national, regional and international significance. Such discourses have helped to enrich the quality of policy dialogues.
As I am given a relative liberty from the organizers, today, I am going to share my thoughts on Nepal’s foreign policy priorities. Before that, I will offer some highlights of the progress made since the formation of the present Government three years ago.
Excellencies,
As you all are aware, the unprecedented outbreak of COVID-19 has inflicted impacts on all aspects of national life and significantly changed the mode of our engagements with the international community. Virtual meetings and interactions have replaced physical conversations and dialogues. We were on the right track to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. The pandemic has slowed down the pace of progress. It has put huge stress on our health infrastructure, crippled the tourism sector and affected inflow of remittances. In the backdrop of economic vulnerabilities, we are resolutely focused on warding off its negative impact in realizing the national aspiration of ‘Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali’.
The foremost priority of the Governments has been the protection of people’s lives and livelihoods. With the generous support of our neighbor India, we have rolled out the vaccination drive to the priority population. This has been complemented by generous support of additional amount of vaccine from our neighbor China. We are grateful to our neighbors as well as friends around the world for their continued support during the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.
The pandemic has taught us the importance of global solidarity in events of such large-scale emergencies. We are committed to advocate for and support to the bilateral, regional and international initiatives that promote such solidarity and cooperation among the nation states and aim to strengthen multilateral institutions created to address such global challenges.
Dear Friends,
As the present Government has just completed three years in office, I feel it pertinent to share where we stand on some of the critical indicators that matter to the lives of our people.
Peace and security situation has improved. We have been able to bring almost all disgruntled political groups to the political mainstream through dialogue. Backchannel talks are underway with the CPN led by Biplab.
Nepal fared generally well even during the pandemic. Anti-COVID vaccines are being provided to all citizens free-of-cost. Over nine hundred thousand people have been lifted out of absolute poverty. The per capita income has increased to US dollar 1,097—a 35 percent rise in Rupees terms. The 2020 Human Development Report has recorded improvements in education, health, drinking water and sanitation.
An additional 2,718 kilometers road has been blacktopped and additional 333 megawatts of electricity has been added to national grid. The population having access to electricity and drinking water has reached to 90 percent.
Post-earthquake reconstruction is in concluding phase, including the restitution of some rich and treasured historical monuments. Seven hundred thousand private homes have been built.
Literacy rate has reached an encouraging 85 percent. With basic education made free for all, universal enrollment and gender parity at school level have been achieved.
The economy of the country showed improvement and resilience even during the pandemic. The Economist, a renowned British weekly, listed Nepal among top 10 emerging economies. The World Bank’s Doing Business Indicators-2020 has correctly acknowledged the improvements in investment-friendly atmosphere. Nepal has made improvement in 14 governance indicators. We are among the countries to have made good progress in human development, ease of doing business, hunger, peace, rule of law, corruption control and transparency, happiness , and gender parity indices.
For the first time, Nepal has graduated from the World Bank’s low-income category to lower-middle income category. The UN Committee on Development Policy has recently recommended for Nepal’s graduation from an LDC status. This makes an important watershed in the development trajectory of the country.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I hope you are aware about the developments in the political front. The Supreme Court has given its verdict. Accordingly, the Right Honourable President has called for the session of the Parliament to be convened from 23rd of Falgun. The Government remains firmly committed to the democratic process and we have full confidence in our constitutional system.
As regard to the conduct of our foreign relations, the Constitution of Nepal defines the fundamentals of Nepal’s foreign policy. Besides defining the core parameters of national interests, the Constitution also guides us to pursue independent foreign policy by adhering to the principles enshrined in the UN Charter, non-alignment, panchasheel, international law and the norms of world peace. Last year, the Government adopted a consolidated foreign policy document that outlines broad foreign policy principles and priorities and emphasizes on the strengthening of institutions to implement them. Cognizant of the evolving global situation, Nepal has been conducting foreign policy to the service of our core national interests and achieve economic development and prosperity. ‘Amity with all, enmity with none’ has been the motto of our foreign relations.
Firmly pedestaled on the cardinal principles of national independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, freedom and national unity, our foreign policy aims to preserve and promote national interest and conduct foreign relations on the basis of equality, justice, mutual respect and benefits.
At the bilateral level, Nepal remains committed to maintaining friendly relations with her neighbours and all other countries in the world. Over the years, both the substance and our engagements with the immediate neighbors–India and China–have increased manifold. We maintain close and cordial relationship with them based on goodwill, trust, mutual respect and cooperation. Nepal fulfills its commitment not to allow any activity in her territory against the neighbors and expects similar spirit of cooperation from our neighbors on the matters of our concern.
High-level engagements with India have contributed to further enriching the already intense relationship characterized by robust people-to-people contacts, cultural linkages and extensive economic partnership. We have achieved good progress in some of the landmark connectivity projects, such as, the Motihari-Amlekhgunj Petroleum Pipeline, the first cross border pipeline in the region, and operationalization of Integrated Check Post in Birjung and Biratnagar, and completion of Jaynagar-Kurtha section of railway.
Recently, in January this year, we held a bilateral meeting of Nepal-India Joint Commission at the level of Foreign Ministers. We reviewed the entire gamut of bilateral relations from border management to cooperation in the areas of trade, transit, culture, education, and health, among others. As regard to the unfinished tasks of the boundary, both sides are committed to resolve them through dialogues.
Similarly, Nepal and China enjoy close and cordial relationship, which is based on the five principles of peaceful co-existence. Appreciation of each other’s aspirations as well as respect for each other’s concerns and sensitivities has been the hallmark of our relationship. Nepal is fully committed to one China policy.  Nepal-China relations have witnessed substantive growth with the exchange of high-level visits and an enhanced level of economic partnership. The President of China visited Nepal in 2019 after an interval of 23 years. Connectivity, trade, investment as well as several other areas of development have been our priorities for collaboration. With the entry into force of the Transit Transport Protocol, we have also agreed to implement the trans-Himalaya multi-dimensional connectivity network that will open up new vistas in cross-border transit transport.
Beyond our neighborhood, Nepal maintains close and cooperative relationship with the development partners as well as the destination countries of Nepali migrant workers.
Nepal’s relations with the development partners and major powers have always remained cordial and cooperative. For the first time in about 20 years, Prime Minister Rt. Hon. K P Sharma Oli paid official visits to the United Kingdom and France. In my capacity as the Foreign Minister, I paid official visits to the United States after 17 years and the Russian Federation after 14 years.
Our development partners have been major sources of finance and technology in critical areas of Nepal’s development endeavor for decades. We are grateful to our development partners for this generous cooperation and continued goodwill. Nepal received moral support from our development partners during the peace process. In the aftermath of the devastating earthquakes of 2015, there was an overwhelming support in rescue, relief and reconstruction. Support measures from our development partners in the forms of technical, financial, trade and investment will be important as we prepare for graduation from LDC status. Support for the timely realization of sustainable development goals will contribute to post-COVID recovery efforts as well. We continue to work towards enriching the substance of cooperation in our bilateral engagements with these countries.
We also attach high importance to our relations with the countries of destination of Nepali migrant workers. We have engaged extensively with these important partners for the safety, security and wellbeing of our migrant workers. The Right Honourable Prime Minister and myself held several telephone calls with high level leaders from the labour destination countries with a view to addressing the specific concerns and vulnerabilities of Nepali migrant workers in the context of COVID-19. Nepal’s emphasis continues to be on the issues related to decent work, ethical recruitment, welfare of migrants including female workers, consular support and cooperation, financial literacy, and labor market assessment. We are keen to expand broader economic partnership with these countries beyond labour migration and intend to promote trade, tourism, investment and people to people contacts.
In the regional context, we aim to promote economic cooperation, peace and development. Nepal’s commitment to regional cooperation is evident from our active engagements with SAARC and BIMSTEC processes. As the current chair of SAARC, we have engaged with all the member States in a constructive and cooperative spirit. It has been our consistent view that the SAARC process needs revitalization for effective delivery on its stated objectives, including the promotion of mutual trust and confidence among its members.
As mandated by the 4th Summit held in Kathmandu, BIMSTEC is in the process of institution building and further consolidating modalities of cooperation.
Nepal is also keenly participating in the activities of other regional organizations, including the Asia Cooperation Dialogue (ACD) as a member and Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) as a dialogue partner.
Excellencies,
Nepal’s multilateral engagements are longstanding and productive. We take the universal values and principles enshrined in the UN Charter 75 years ago as the cardinal principles for international relations. We consider that the United Nations should be at the center of multilateralism and global efforts towards achieving peace, security and development.
The relevance of multilateralism has become more pronounced as we confront with global scale challenges ranging from pandemic to transnational organized crimes to terrorism. Nepal commits to collaborate for strengthening of a just, fair and rules-based world order.
Three years after joining the United Nations, Nepal began its contributions to the cause of international peace and security. Currently the fourth largest troop and police contributing country, Nepal’s contribution to the UN peace operations has earned worldwide respect.
As an LDC, we are also working at global platforms on a number of agendas that bear importance to us, such as enhancing effectiveness of development cooperation and securing transit rights of landlocked countries.
Climate change and biodiversity are critical issues for Nepal. Nepal firmly supports the effective implementation of the Paris Agreement. As we prepare for the COP26, we intend to contribute to the larger policy discourse on climate change by dedicating the first episode of ‘Sagarmatha Sambaad’ on ‘Climate Change, Mountains and the Future of the Humanity’. Nepal recently updated the NDCs on climate change. We are developing a long-term strategy for a net zero-carbon scenario by 2050. A higher level of climate financing is needed for achieving these targets. We believe, COP26 provides an opportunity to generate much-needed political will to save the planet for humanity.
Our commitment to human rights and rule of law has been unwavering. In fulfilling its obligations under the instruments to which we are a state party, Nepal very much stays in the course. Earlier this year, we successfully concluded the third cycle of UPR. We are encouraged by the interests and appreciation shown by the UN member states.
Over the years, Nepal has started enhancing its visibility in the international arena. For the first time, Nepal has been invited to the World Economic Forum and the Oxford Union. Nepal has been re-elected as the member of the UN Human Rights Council (HRC) and also at the CEDAW Committee. Currently, Nepal Chairs the 2nd Committee of the 75th UNGA and Board of the Enhanced Integrated Framework under the WTO. Having entrusted to various other intergovernmental bodies and processes, we have been working alongside the international community on global agendas.
Dear Friends,
Nepal’s diplomatic outreach has expanded significantly with the establishment of diplomatic relations with a total of 168 countries.
On economic diplomacy, promoting Nepal’s export trade, foreign investments, technology transfer, tourism industry and safeguarding the interests and wellbeing of our migrant workers are our main priorities. We intend to promote Nepal’s soft power by utilizing the country’s natural beauty and cultural heritages, among others.
The role of Nepali diaspora in national development and building cultural connections has been well recognized. We are committed to protecting interests of Nepali nationals abroad and to utilizing knowledge, expertise and capital of the NRNs. Brain Gain Centre, created in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 2018 with the objective of utilizing knowledge and expertise of diaspora in national development, has now over a thousand entries. We are in the process of further consolidating the BGC as a bridge between the Nepali diaspora and Nepal’s national development endeavors.
Before I conclude, let be once again thank the NCWA for hosting this important event and bringing together a galaxy of foreign policy practitioners, experts and diplomats. The goal of a country’s foreign policy is to serve its vital national interests and support realization of national aspiration. Nepal’s foreign policy has served that goal very well.
I thank you for your attention.

Statement by Honourable Mr. Pradeep Kumar Gyawali, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Head of the Nepali delegation at the High-Level Segment of the 46th Session of Human Rights Council
Geneva, 23 February 2021
Madam President,
Madam High Commissioner,
Excellencies,
Distinguished Delegates.
It is a great pleasure to represent Nepal in the 46th Session of the Human Rights Council.
At the outset, I congratulate you madam President and the Bureau of the Council, and assure you of our full support in steering the Session.
Madam President,
The world continues to bear the brunt of the COVID-19 pandemic. Development of vaccines and vaccination drive that followed give a hope to every country, including Nepal.
In this context, we sincerely appreciate our neighbors India and China for the vaccine support. We are also encouraged by the recent announcement of initial vaccine delivery by COVAX. We have already rolled out vaccination programme to our priority population
Madam President,
Nepal’s commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights is total and unequivocal. We firmly believe in the universality, indivisibility, interdependence, interrelatedness and mutually reinforcing nature of human rights, including the right to development.
We are a party to all major international human rights instruments including seven of the nine core instruments. The values and standards enshrined in those instruments have been incorporated in our national legal, policy, and operational frameworks.
The Constitution of Nepal is founded on universally recognized human rights values and principles including equality, non-discrimination, justice, and the rule of law, among others.
Social justice is deeply embedded in our democratic system. Special measures have been taken to enable weaker sections of our society to enjoy fundamental rights and for their fair representation in all spheres of national life. Discrimination in any form is punishable by law.
Nepal has abolished death penalty. As a secular State, freedom of religion is guaranteed by the constitution. The religious tolerance and harmony in Nepali society has remained exemplary.
We recognize the role of civil society, human rights defenders, and the media in the promotion and protection of human rights.
Conforming to the Paris Principles and accredited as ‘A’ category, the National Human Rights Commission of Nepal monitors the human rights situation and enjoys independence in fulfilling its mandate.
Madam President,
We have incorporated Sustainable Development Goals into our national development plan with a view to realizing them by 2030. Complementing the SDGs, Nepal at present is focused in realizing the national aspiration of “Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali”.
We are committed to ensuring full enjoyment of all human rights for women and girls. Nepal’s progress in terms of gender equality and empowerment is reflected in over 41 percent of federal, provincial and local elected offices being represented by women. Areas such as girls’ education, women’s representation in civil service, security agencies and other gainful employment opportunities have all recorded impressive progress.
Every woman has the right to safe motherhood and reproductive health. We have pledged to eliminate all forms of child labour and child marriage.
We are fully committed to the rights of persons with disabilities. Measures of positive discrimination have enabled their participation in political and public life.
As a major country of origin, safety, security, dignity, and welfare of migrant workers remain our utmost priority. Protection of rights of migrant workers, including women migrant workers, and combating human trafficking requires cooperation at origin, transit and destination countries.
As a mountainous least developed country, the impact of global warming is of a particular concern for us. Delivering on climate commitment at national, regional, and global level is important to enable our people fully enjoy all human rights.
Madam President,
Two independent Commissions – the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission for Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons- are investigating the incidences of conflict-era human rights violations. Nepal reaffirms its commitment to conclude the transitional justice process and remains steadfast that there would be no blanket amnesty in cases of serious violation human rights.
Last month, the third cycle of Nepal’s review under the UPR was successfully concluded. We are currently examining the recommendations received in the process.
Nepal greatly values the work of Special Procedures mandate-holders. We look forward to welcoming the Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food and Special Rapporteur on Extreme Poverty and Human Rights this year.
We are committed to fulfill our reporting obligations. Preparation of the latest reports under CAT, ICCPR, ICESCR, and CRC is in progress.
Madam President,
As we work together for a shared goal of promoting and protecting human rights of all and creating a peaceful, prosperous and just world, consistent commitment to multilateralism and cooperation among the UN Member States is critically important. Only through a balanced and objective approach in the universal protection and promotion of all human rights everywhere gives credence to what we do here in the Council and how can we serve the best interests of the people that matter our work the most.
Before concluding, I want to register our profound gratitude to all UN Member States for their support to our re-elections to the Council and the CEDAW Committee as well as assure our constructive engagement with the fellow Member States of the Council to serve its purpose.
I thank you.

Opening Statement by Hon. Mr. Pradeep Kumar Gyawali, Minister for Foreign Affairs to the 37th Session of the HRC Working Group on UPR
Posted onJanuary 21, 2021January 21, 2021 


Opening Statement by Hon. Mr. Pradeep Kumar Gyawali, Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Leader of Nepali Delegation to the 37th Session of the Human Rights Council Working Group on Universal Periodic Review
Geneva, Thursday, 21 January 2021 (13:45 hrs to 17:15 hrs.)
Madam President,
Madam High Commissioner for Human Rights,
Distinguished Members of the Working Group,
Ladies and Gentlemen,

I have the honor to present Nepal’s national report to the UPR Working Group. I appreciate the Human Rights Council for the arrangements made for this review despite the constraints posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Madam President, 

Nepal is guided by the spirit of dialogue and cooperation and considers the Universal Periodic Review as a truly unique, constructive and cooperative mechanism. Let me convey our gratitude to members of the Troika, namely, India, Argentina and Burkina Faso, for facilitating Nepal’s review. As I present the updates on the status of implementation of the recommendations and major strides taken by Nepal since the last review, I reiterate Nepal’s willingness for an open and constructive dialogue with the Member and observer States during this review.
As a member of the Council for the second term, Nepal is grateful to all the UN member States for their support to our candidature during the recently held elections for both the Human Rights Council and CEDAW Committee. Nepal remains firmly committed to the work and effectiveness of the Council for the promotion and protection of human rights.
Today, I am accompanied by the Chief Secretary of the Government of Nepal, Secretary at the Office of the Prime Minister and Council of Ministers and the Secretaries of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs; Home Affairs; Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs; Health and Population; Women, Children, and Senior Citizens; Labour, Employment and Social Security; and Education, Science and Technology.
Nepal’s Ambassador and Permanent Representative in Geneva and officials of the Permanent Mission are joining from Geneva.
A dedicated Committee led by the Office of the Prime Minister and Council of Ministers was formed with cross-sectoral representation for the preparation of the national report. Wider outreach and consultation with the National Human Rights Commission, other constitutional commissions, provincial government and local level bodies, civil society, community organizations, human rights defenders, and the media immensely contributed to the preparatory process. Most of them also provided with the written inputs. In the context of COVID-19 related health protocols and lockdown, some of the planned consultations and workshops had to be conducted in virtual format in all seven provinces,where more than 700 Civil Society Organizations participated. Two consultative meetings were held with the Law, Justice and Human Rights Committee of the House of Representatives. Draft National Report was also disseminated for feedback and comments from all stakeholders and general public. Inputs thus received were incorporated in the final report prior to the submission.
Nepal firmly believes in the universality, indivisibility, interdependence, interrelatedness, and mutually reinforcing nature of human rights, including the right to development. Our commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights is total and unequivocal and we believe that the rule of law and human rights should be evenly operational at national, regional, and international levels. As a State Party to seven core human rights Conventions and six Optional Protocols; seven humanitarian Conventions, including the four Geneva Conventions of 1949; 11 ILO Conventions; and 14 other international and two regional conventions that have direct bearing on human rights, Nepal strongly upholds the values enshrined in those Conventions.
These values are duly internalized in our Constitution in the form of comprehensive bill of fundamental rights, democratic polity, pluralism, the rule of law, accountable government, inclusive participation, and social and economic justice.
A country emerging from conflict amidst compounded odds including the massive Earthquake of 2015 and recurrent natural disasters; we have made sincere efforts for the promotion and protection of human rights of our people.

Madam President,

Nepal had accepted a total of 152 recommendations during the 2ndcycle of UPR in 2015, most of which have now been implemented. A dedicated mechanism at the Office of the Prime Minister and Council of Ministers was designated for the monitoring of the implementation.
Since the last review in 2015, Nepal’s periodic reports under CRC, CRPD, CERD, and CEDAW were considered by the respective treaty bodies. Preparation of such reports under CAT, ICCPR and ICESCR are in progress.
Nepal acceded to the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons Especially Women and Children (Palermo Protocol) in June last year. We intend to build necessary legal and institutional capacity for joining additional international instruments.
Nepal attaches great importance to the work of Special Procedures Mandate-Holders. In 2018, Nepal invited Special Rapporteurs on the Human Rights of Migrants and Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women for a country visit. We look forward to welcoming the Special Rapporteur on the right to food and Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights this year.

Madam President,

The National Human Rights Commission of Nepal, an independent Constitutional body, has been working as a powerful watchdog to protect and promote human rights in the country. Accredited as the “A” category institution, the Commission fully embraces the Paris Principles, and exercises a wide range of investigatory, supervisory, directive, and recommendatory powers for the promotion and protection of human rights.
Other independent thematic Commissions on Women, Dalit, Indigenous Nationalities, Madheshi, Tharu, and Muslim Community have been actively working for the promotion and protection of rights and interests of the specific communities.
Nepal’s independent judiciary acts as the guardian of human rights and fundamental freedoms. It has the power of judicial review to assess the constitutionality of any laws passed by federal, provincial, or village or municipal legislature. The Judiciary has given landmark judicial pronouncements, expanding the scope of human rights jurisprudence.

Madam President,

Nepal embarked upon a new era of political transformation in 2006 which was consolidated by the democratic Constitution adopted in 2015 by the Constituent Assembly. The Constitution guarantees a wide array of civil, political, social, economic and cultural rights akin to those provided by international human rights instruments. It consolidates an inclusive and participatory federal democratic republican order following the successful transformation of conflict into peace through a home-grown, nationally led and owned peace process.
The Constitution of Nepal is founded on the value of equality and non-discrimination and guarantees special provisions for the empowerment and development of the backward section of society. Nepal has long abolished death penalty. Effective constitutional and judicial remedies are provided in case of infringement of the fundamental rights. As one of the pioneer countries to implement National Human Rights Action Plan since 2004, we are now implementing the 5th series of such Action Plan. Implementation and follow up of UPR and treaty bodies recommendations are integral part of it.
Over the past four years, a comprehensive, transparent, and consultative legal reform process was undertaken both to implement Nepal’s human rights commitments as well as to drive the federalization process. Necessary fundamental-rights-implementing-laws have been enacted within three years after the adoption of the Constitution. Several prevailing laws have been revised and consolidated, and dozens of new laws have been enacted.
A new set of rights, such as, right to live in a clean and healthy environment; right to food; right to social security; and the rights specific to senior citizens and children have been guaranteed by the Constitution.
In 2017, Nepal successfully held free, fair, transparent, and broad-based participatory elections at the federal, provincial, and local levels, embracing the principle of proportional and inclusive representation while institutionalizing democratic and accountable governance at all levels. Nepal has a woman as the Head of State. Earlier, we had women as the President, Chief Justice, and Speaker of the Parliament at the same time, which reflects a rare example of women empowerment in national leadership. It is mandatory to have at least two women out of five local-level ward members and one of them must be from the Dalit community.
Currently, women constitute 41 percent of elected public offices and 25 percent of civil service. Women participation in labour force has reached 83 percent. As we recently celebrated the 25thanniversary of Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, Nepal is happy to share these achievements.
Women are fully empowered by the Constitution and enjoy right to lineage and equal rights in the family matters and property. Sexual and reproductive health rights of every woman and girl have been firmly established by law. Sexual violence constitutes a serious crime. Polygamy, child marriage, forced marriage, sexual harassment in the workplace as well as sexual and domestic violence are strictly punishable by law. Enforcement of the laws related to human trafficking and domestic violence has been further strengthened to end gender-based violence and discrimination.
Nepal stands among a few countries that have been implementing UN Security Council Resolutions 1325 and 1820 on Women, Peace and Security through a National Plan of Action. We are one of the pioneer countries to implement gender-responsive budget system since 2007.

Madam President,

Right to peaceful assembly and association, freedom of expression, and right to information are prerequisites for good governance. Nepal regards civil society and the media as indispensable partners in the promotion and protection of human rights. Nepal has formulated Digital Nepal Framework 2019 to unlock Nepal’s growth potential through the wider use of digital technology. In an ever-changing digital world, ensuring access to quality information, digital inclusion, and the protection of every citizen’s privacy and wellbeing becomes important consideration.
A multi-ethnic, multi-lingual, multi-religious and multi-cultural country, Nepal believes in equality, inclusion, secularism, non-discrimination, social justice and development of all of its people.
Discrimination on the basis of class, caste, region, language, religion, and gender are outlawed. Discrimination in public places and in the use of public services and utilities is strictly prohibited. Stringent legal and enforcement measures have been taken to investigate and punish any of such acts. Untouchability is strictly punishable under the law.
Nepal has ratified the ILO Convention 169 on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples. The Indigenous people and those from the communities on the verge of extinction have the right to get special opportunities and benefits from the state. Two independent and empowered entities – the Indigenous Nationalities Commission, a constitutional body and the National Foundation for Development of Indigenous People, a statutory body, work to look after the rights and interest of indigenous people. The right-based policy measures are incorporated in the national development plans for ensuring their participation.
The Constitution guarantees special measures for minorities and the marginalized sections of the society so as to enable them to enjoy fundamental rights and receive a fair share of representation in all spheres of national life.
Inclusive development interventions have been made to improve living condition of the backward section of our society and empower them in all aspects of national life and nurture social harmony and cohesion. Targeted programs for poverty reduction, literacy and employment generation have been implemented. The 15thNational Development Plan, which is currently under implementation, aims at promoting inclusive economic growth and creating broad-based foundation for prosperity.
Being a secular State, the Constitution of Nepal guarantees freedom of religion as a fundamental right. Social and cultural harmony, tolerance, and unity in diversity are the inherent tenets of Nepal’s identity.  The Penal Code criminalizes hate speech, attacks against the religious sites and activities aimed at creating religious discords. Nepal believes that freedom of religion cannot be impaired by coercion or monetary inducement for conversion.
Nepal has been giving utmost importance to tackling the issues of torture, impunity, gender-based violence, exclusion, and inequality. The right of a victim of crime, right against torture, and right against preventive detention has been recognized as the fundamental rights. Any form of physical or mental torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment for any reason is prohibited, and those acts are punishable by law. A victim of torture is entitled to compensation.
Human rights cells have been established in all security agencies, including Nepal Police. Conditions of the prison have been improved with the piloting of open prison system.
The National Penal Code criminalizes torture, rape, and other forms of sexual violence. Statutory limitations for the prosecution of cases of torture and rape have been extended.
Nepali laws protect the right to justice for the victims of crimes in all stages of investigation, adjudication and social rehabilitation. Special arrangements have been made for victims of rape and sexual violence with regard to limitation and privacy in hearing the cases.
Nepal remains committed to conclude the transitional justice process through the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons. Nepal’s transitional justice process is guided by the Comprehensive Peace Accord, the directives of the Supreme Court, relevant international commitments, concerns of the victims, and the ground realities. The Government is steadfast that there would be no blanket amnesty in cases of serious violation of human rights.
Nepal considers NGOs and Civil Societies as the building blocks of democracy and human rights and has been forging a constructive and cooperative partnership with NGOs, INGOs, Human Rights Defenders and Civil Society Organizations. A total of 237 INGOs and more than 51,000 NGOs are affiliated to Social Welfare Council, Nepal, which reflects a strong manifestation of the important space being provided to the civil society in Nepal. The reports submitted by NGOs for this review are the testimonies of their vibrant presence in Nepal.
The Constitution has guaranteed the rights of sexual minorities to participate in the State bodies on the basis of inclusive principle. To protect the identity of LGBTI persons, the census and electoral rolls recognize them under “others” category for data entry. Citizenship certificates and passports have been provided with identity of “others” category. Discrimination based on sexual orientation is punishable.

Madam President,

Nepali labour laws protect equal pay for equal value of work for both men and women. The Government has also specified minimum wages for workers. A minimum paid employment of 100 days has been guaranteed for those who do not have gainful employment. Women workers are entitled to paid-maternity leave. Forced labour has been prohibited. Workers have the right to form trade union and engage in collective bargaining.
Nepal has become one of the pathfinder countries of the global partnership, Alliance 8.7, to fulfill its commitment towards ending all kinds of child labour by 2025. Nepal reaffirms its commitment to the promotion and protection of the rights of the child. Ending child labour, forced labour, and trafficking in children is in high priority of the Government.
The right-based and inclusive approach has been adopted while devising the plans and policies to protect the rights of persons with disabilities. The Disability Rights Act, 2017recognizes self-empowerment of persons with disabilities. New building code requires public buildings to be disability friendly. Provision of adequate resources and infrastructures for quality and inclusive education of children with disabilities remains our continued priority.
Every community has the right to basic education in its mother tongue, and the right to preserve and promote its language, and script. The right of every child to receive a free and compulsory basic education, including books and educational materials has been protected by law. Every citizen is entitled to get free education up to the secondary level. Universal enrolment and gender parity in school have been almost achieved with a significant reduction in dropout of girls. Monthly scholarships and day meals are provided to the children from Dalits communities, backward regions, and other marginalized communities. Hygiene kits are provided to the adolescent girl students. Distance learning via radio and online classes has been conducted in the pandemic situation.
The Government has reserved 45 percent of scholarships for higher education in medical sciences to students graduated from community schools and for those coming from backward section of our society. Other programs such as day nutrition, scholarship to 50 percent girls at the primary level and provision of women teachers in a specific ratio have produced positive results in terms of increasing enrollment and reducing dropouts.
Human rights education constitutes part of curriculums of education institutions and training of the public officials, including security agencies. Awareness-raising activities have been regularly conducted by both the Government agencies and civil society organizations. Necessary legal and institutional mechanisms have been established to ensure access to justice for all.
The extension of social care and protection has made our cities free from street-children, street-people, and beggars. “Street Children Free Kathmandu Valley” initiative has been implemented and over a thousand street children have already been rescued.
Necessary laws have been enacted to safeguard the right to a clean environment and access to clean drinking water and sanitation. In September 2019, Nepal declared herself as the open defecation free country.
Every citizen has the right to free and equal access to basic health services from the State. Significant progress has been made in strengthening the health system and improving health services of the citizens to ensure universal health services. Under the National Health Insurance scheme, Government of Nepal pays premium for health insurance of the poor, orphans, elderly and persons with disabilities. The coverage of the insurance has been extended to 563 Local Levels of 58 districts with a target of universal coverage eventually.
Free medical treatment is provided to senior citizens above 75 years of age for severe diseases related to heart, kidney, and cancer. Health insurance for the elderly people has been further expanded.
We have recently laid foundations for the construction of basic hospitals in all 396 local levels across the country to provide quality health services at the local level. Infectious disease hospitals are being built in each of the seven provinces.
The elderly, single woman, Dalit, persons with disability, destitute, indigents, and people belonging to the ethnic group on the verge of extinction receive monthly social security allowances. Social security and special protections are recognized as fundamental rights of senior citizens. A comprehensive contribution-based social security scheme has been rolled out by the Government that provides coverage to the workers in formal and informal sectors.
Nepal attaches high priority to the safety, security, and wellbeing of the migrant workers. We have concluded bilateral agreements with several destination countries for the security, protection and welfare of the migrant workers. Effective implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development along with the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration is essential to make migration safe, dignified and work for all.
The President Women Upliftment Program, Prime Minister Employment Program and Prime Minister Agricultural Modernization Project are being implemented as the flagship programs to generate employment within the country. Returnee migrant workers are provided with concessional loans and other incentives to start self-employment or entrepreneurial activities.
Even though we are not a party to the Refugee Convention and its Protocol, Nepal has sheltered Tibetan and Bhutanese refugees for decades on humanitarian grounds. The extradition law of Nepal fully recognizes the principle of non-refoulment.

Madam President,

The reconstruction work of residential houses, schools, colleges, hospitals, heritage sites, and infrastructures damaged by the devastating earthquakes in 2015 is nearing completion. We have built better infrastructures and capacity for responding to the natural disasters and protecting the lives of people.
Effective and timely implementation of SDGs and other internationally agreed development goals through enhanced partnership and collaboration is a key to the protection of all human rights, including the right to development. Nepal has mainstreamed SDGs into the national development plans and policies with a view to realize them by 2030.
Poverty reduction remains an overarching development agenda of the Government. We have aimed to reduce poverty to 5% by 2030 and 0% by 2043.We are committed to achieve zero hunger goals of SDGs by ensuring food and nutrition for all. We have been working with the vision of “No one should remain hungry, no one dies of hunger”. Prime Minister Agriculture Modernization Project, Advanced Seed Program and Agriculture Insurance Programme have been implemented to ensure food and nutrition security.
Being a mountainous and agricultural country, Nepal is vulnerable to climate change challenges such as melting of glaciers, glacial lake outbursts, soil erosion, decrease in productivity, desertification, loss of biodiversity, floods, and landslides, which have become recurring challenges. Nepal is developing a National Adaptation Plan and corresponding Climate Finance Strategy and Roadmap in all local levels. We have set an ambitious target of achieving a net zero-carbon scenario by 2050.
Human Development Index Report 2020 shows some improvement in Nepal’s HDI value. Our economy has recently been elevated to a lower-middle-income country and we are preparing to graduate from the status of the least developed country. Nepal was recording strong economic growth rates in the years preceding to the pandemic.
The health and education-related indicators, especially nutrition and schooling, in which we were lagging behind, have received renewed priority, including through reforms of public schools for quality education. Investing in people and preventing them from re-lapsing into poverty remains the key challenges.
Nepal under the able leadership of Prime Minister Rt. Honorable Mr. K P Sharma Oli has embraced a long-term vision of “Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali”. Despite resource constraints, we have significantly increased investment in infrastructures and social sectors.
Good governance has been our priority. Adequate resources have been allocated both for prevention as well as investigation and prosecution of the cases of improper conduct and corruption.

Madam President,

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has severe impact on livelihoods, economy, public health and social security systems. The Government of Nepal has responded to the COVID-19 pandemic through measures, such as, prevention, control, isolation, quarantine and treatment and has adopted various health and safety protocols in compliance with WHO guidelines. We are guided primarily by the three objectives – strengthening of the health care system, protecting people’s lives, and building a sustainable and resilient recovery.
Testing and treatment services are provided free of charge to the needy people. Necessary infrastructures, human and financial resources, and medical equipment are ensured to the health systems at all levels. With a combination of measures employed, we have been able to keep low mortality and higher rate of recovery among the COVID-19 patients.
With the outbreak of a new variant of the virus and continued risk of transmission, Nepal, like other LDCs is struggling with capacity constraints. Strengthening the health care system and addressing the needs of vulnerable segment of population remain our top priority.
While development of vaccines has given a new hope, availability and affordability of vaccines becomes critical for a country like Nepal requiring greater international cooperation and solidarity. We commend the initiative of COVAX and generosity of our neighbors to ensure availability of vaccines. The Government of Nepal has already decided to provide the vaccines free of cost to the people.
To conclude, Madam President, Nepal is striving its best for achieving the sustainable development goals and remains committed to ensuring the full enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms by every citizen. I look forward to a constructive dialogue as we continue the review process.

I thank you for your kind attention.

Statement by Hon. Mr. Pradeep Kumar Gyawali, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Government of Nepal at the 17th Ministerial Meeting of Asia Cooperation Dialogue (ACD) (Virtual, Ankara, 21 January 2021) 
Mr. Chairman,
Hon. Ministers,
His Excellency the Secretary General of ACD,
Distinguished Delegates,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Good Morning and Namaste!
Let me begin by expressing my sincere appreciations to the Government of the Republic of Turkey for successfully steering the organization and hosting this meeting. I commend the Secretary General of ACD and his team at the Secretariat for the excellent preparation.
Nineteen years ago, in 2002, we founded the Asian Cooperation Dialogue (ACD) with the objective of promoting dialogue, mutual understanding, and interdependence among Asian countries and improving the quality of life of our people. I believe, today’s meeting will be yet another milestone in generating further impetus to the ACD process towards this direction.
As we confront with the unprecedented crisis of COVID-19 pandemic, the theme of the meeting “The New Normal and Safe and Healthy Tourism,” carries a significant meaning for the new normal that we have to live with.
Mr. Chairman,
The pandemic has caused a colossal damage everywhere disrupting our lives, livelihoods, and economies. It has also hugely impacted the hard-earned development gains, including achievement of SDGs. Tourism, undoubtedly, is the hardest-hit sector by this pandemic.
Nepal has placed top priority to protect people’s lives from the disease and hunger. We have initiated necessary policies and programs to provide budgetary relief, incentives, and stimulus packages to the affected people and sectors, including the tourism sector.
Nepal has scrupulously been executing safety, health and sanitation protocols in all tourism related activities supported by awareness programs at people’s level. Domestic and international flights are being gradually opened ensuring compliance with proper health and security measures. Our focus is to save jobs and keep the economy afloat, and revive the travel and hospitality industry following new set of norms and health protocols.
We are keen to work with fellow member states in boosting the testing, tracing, screening and treatment of the Covid-19 patients. Synchronized and effective systems need to be put in place for testing of international travellers at the source, transit and destination countries to reduce the health risk and develop confidence of the travellers.
Close cooperation among the member states as well as partnership with private business is critically important for bringing the tourism sector to normality, particularly while opening international borders, flights, and peoples’ movement.
Sharing of best practices, knowledge, skills and experiences in this regard would also be highly crucial so as to sustain the new norms in the new normal and prevent sudden upsurge of the pandemic.
In parallel, we need to ensure easy and affordable access to vaccines and other essential medical items to check the virus and gradually return to the normalcy.
Mr. Chairman,
As an emerging global economic powerhouse, Asia assumes the leading role in global trade, supply chain, and innovation. Blessed with abundant natural and human resources; and, being a rich mosaic of diverse history, culture, civilization, geography, economies and political systems; the continent truly holds a high potential for socio-economic development, technological advancement and prosperity.
Development and improvement of quality of infrastructure is a key to build connectivity in ACD region, economic integration, inclusive growth and people-to-people contact. For a landlocked country like Nepal, ensuring all modes of connectivity will be the key enabler to narrow the development gap and achieve equitable and inclusive growth.
Equally vital would be the promotion of investment and business activities in such priority areas as agriculture, energy, connectivity, tourism, education, science, technology and innovation, as well as sustainable development.
It is imperative to enhance cooperation and collaboration for mitigation and adaption of the adverse impacts of climate change and natural disasters.
Mr. Chairman,
Nepal accords high priority to regional cooperation. We have full confidence on principles, values and goals of ACD. We stand ready to proactively engage with the fellow Member States to advance the ACD process.
We believe that ACD can play a significant role in strengthening mutual trust, forging common understanding, and promoting cooperation and collaboration among the Member States for peace, stability, shared development, and prosperity of the Asian nations.
I thank you all.

Talks Given by Minister for Foreign Affairs of Nepal  Hon. Mr. Pradeep Kumar Gyawali,  at the Indian Council of World Affairs (Sapru House)
Posted onJanuary 15, 2021January 15, 2021 

New Delhi, 15 January 2021
Ambassador Dr. T C A Raghavan, Director General of ICWA
Distinguished diplomats, scholars, and professors present here, and those who have joined us virtually,
Friends from the media, 
Ladies and Gentlemen.
It is indeed a great pleasure for me to speak before this distinguished audience.
I sincerely thank the Indian Council of World Affairs for this opportunity and for the warm reception. I thank you, Ambassador Dr. Raghavan, for your kind words of introduction.
That many eminent people are virtually linked for this conversation reflects the interest you all have on Nepal.
For me, this demonstrates your goodwill about Nepal as well as the importance attached to Nepal-India relations.
Dear Friends,
Nepal is not unfamiliar to you. Neither is the kind of political transformation that Nepal has achieved in the recent decades.
It rarely happened elsewhere in the world that a society succeeds to smoothly shift from armed conflict to peaceful political process, agrees on the agenda of socio-political restructuring, accomplish the journey from bullet to ballot and the entire process culminates in the making of the inclusive constitution by people’s elected representatives.
The Constitution that we made guarantees human rights and fundamental freedoms to all citizens without any discrimination. It seeks to promote socio-economic justice to the backward communities in our society. In the past three years, our focus has been on translating the same constitutional aspiration into reality.
In a diverse society like ours, where political forces carry contesting ideologies, managing transition was not easy. But we did it with a firm resolve. It was a resolve to transform society and empower everyone.
I must mention here that in accomplishing this historic change, we received valuable support from all of our friends and well-wishers in the neighbourhood and around the world, for which we are most thankful.
Post-constitution transition remained short. As envisaged in the Constitution, elections were held for local, provincial and federal legislatures in 2017. After 20 years’ gap, the local bodies received elected leadership. And we have already started to see the positive impacts of the empowered local bodies at the grassroot level. The newly established provincial governments have also proven their importance.
A decision has recently been taken to go to the sovereign people for a fresh mandate. These elections will be yet another important occasion for expressing popular will and further strengthening our democratic foundation.
Political process having taken a settled course, our focus is now on the other aspects of people’s freedom, namely freedom from poverty and underdevelopment; freedom from hardships of deprived living; freedom from worry about the basic needs; freedom to pursue a healthy and prosperous life.
We are fully aware that political gains can only be sustained if we are able to create a robust economic foundation.
And to this end, our government, under the leadership of Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli, is resolutely focused on realizing the national aspiration of ‘prosperous Nepal, happy Nepali’. For this, we have rearranged our economic development priorities, defined time bound goals, and implemented them with all our strengths.
In the past three years, Nepal has made significant strides in various dimensions of socio-economic transformation. The pace and intensity of the transformation has never been more visible and impactful. The country has progressed on most of the development indicators.
Prior to COVID 19 pandemic, Nepal was in the list of top 10 countries with high economic growth. The rate of growth had been above 6.5% continuously for the past 3 years. At the same time, poverty level was reduced by 1.5% every year.
During the same period, Nepal achieved significant improvements in more than 14 global indicators. It is encouraging that we were among the top 10 countries in making improvements in human development index, ease of doing business, hunger index, peace index, rule of law, corruption control and transparency, happiness index, and gender parity.
Trade deficit has come down by 10%; FDI has increased; development cooperation has increased; and we are in a better situation in terms of foreign currency reserve.
Works related to strategic infrastructure critical for Nepal’s   development including cross border railways, East-West electric railway, waterways, new airports, Kathmandu-Terai Expressway are moving ahead. Construction and upgradation of Mid Hill Highway together with expansion of East-West Highway are ongoing.
Guided by the motto of economic growth with social justice, the government has initiated the contribution-based universal social security scheme. Health insurance has reached more than sixty districts.
Despite Covid 19, school enrollment has reached 98%. In health sector, just last month, we laid the foundation stone for new hospitals of 5 to 15 beds capacity in 396 urban and village municipalities to be built simultaneously. This was a historic announcement made with the purpose of ensuring people’s access to health services even in the remotest part of the country.
Post-earthquake reconstruction works are nearing completion, including the restitution of some of the rich and treasured historical icons. Seven lakhs private homes have been built and I am glad to share that these include 47 thousand houses built under government of India’s generous assistance. People living in vulnerable locations have been shifted to safe settlements.
We are mindful that these achievements are not adequate. There is much more to do.
Our development needs are immense and aspirations are boundless. Resources are limited and challenges are numerous. And many of these challenges we cannot confront alone; many of our aspirations we cannot meet by our lone efforts.
That is why we need partners; we need friends. Natural start of such friendship is neighbourhood. We see a natural connection between our aspiration for prosperity with the prosperity of our big neighbours.
This would mean for us a robust economic partnership that enables us to grow and unleash our potentials;

a partnership that helps overcome Nepal’s structural bottlenecks as landlocked and least developed country;
a partnership that fosters mutually rewarding and beneficial trade relationship;
a partnership that propels the process of industrialization, flow of investment, transfer of technology and connects our economies in value chain;
a partnership that leads to better utilization of our natural resources for sustained economic growth and development; and
a partnership that makes our relations impactful to the lives of our peoples.

Distinguished Friends,
Our two countries are connected by geography as well as history, by nature as well as culture. Both our societies are blessed with ancient wisdom and heritage whose timelessness has been universally recognized.
When we come to the context of our relations today, the key question is how much we can serve the aspirations of people; to what extent we can be supportive of each other’s quest for growth and development.
Both our countries are highly diverse societies and have our own unique experiences of managing this diversity. We have similar aspirations and face identical challenges in pursuit of respective national goals. Our developmental challenges are similar too. Poverty is still significant in our countries. We face the urgency to ensure that our people have a decent home, decent clothes and quality food; that our youths receive quality education that makes them competent and competitive.
These common urgencies do tell us why economic development should be more crucial in our contemporary conversations; why we need to forge close economic partnership to that end; and why cooperative relations between our two countries is important.
Nepal-India relations are the vast confluence of political and economic interactions as well as unique ties at people-to-people level. It cannot be confined to one dimension alone.
In political sphere, both countries have been brought closer by their steadfast commitment to democratic values, practices and system of governance. India has demonstrated how democracy and development could be successfully pursued together so as to promote overall progress and prosperity of the people.
Nepal is equally effortful to consolidate democracy and strengthen democratic institutions so that the gains of our long struggles remain unshakable.
In order to carry forward our multi-faceted relations, we have built a large network of bilateral mechanisms in almost all sectors of cooperation. There are close to three dozen mechanisms that are currently functioning at various levels and in different areas.
I am in Delhi this time to hold the meeting of one such important mechanism with my distinguished counterpart, Dr Jaishankar, the External Affairs Minister of India.
Needless to say that relationship between neighbours has its own characters. Mutual trust, understanding and respect for each other’s sensitivities and concerns contribute to strengthen the foundation of such relationship. Building and nurturing trust is absolutely essential for the health and harmony of the relations.
In this spirit, we desire to start the conversation with a view to resolving the question of boundary alignment in the remaining segments. Many of you may be aware that Nepal and India share over 1,800 km long international boundary most of which is jointly mapped. Only in the stretches of some kilometers, the work remains to be completed.
Finding an agreeable boundary alignment in these segments may not only take us to the stage of fully settled international boundary but may also help generate positive vibe in public sentiment as well as help instill greater degree of trust and confidence in bilateral relations. I believe that we can work out and reach that stage.
While both sides have agreed to resolve the boundary question through talks, we have also shown wisdom that despite the difference in one area, the momentum of our overall engagements is continued. We are also mindful that we should not let any outstanding issue between us be there forever and become irritant in an otherwise friendly relationship.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
For Nepal, India remains the largest trading partner. However, the problem of bilateral trade deficit looms large. Our economy cannot sustain this alarmingly high trade imbalance.
In the process of the review of the bilateral trade arrangement, we have proposed certain measures that would offer us some genuine space and help us expand our export base. We expect positive and forthcoming consideration of these measures. Nepal is not a competitor of India in trade. I am sure many of you would agree when I say that making Nepal economically strong serves India’s interest too.
We have likewise flagged a few proposals for expansion and streamlining of the current transit arrangements. We like to see an early conclusion of this review process as well.
Nepal and India are endowed with resources, both natural and human. The 21st century should not merely be the century of potentials and resources – lying untapped and unused. It should be the century of dream realization.
Talking about potentials, hydropower development is an important sector of bilateral economic partnership. It will benefit the people and industries of both our countries. We need to generate a success story by sincerely implementing the projects agreed in the past. Pancheshwar project comes atop. Our recent conversation on this transformative mega project has been encouraging. Once realized, Pancheshwar will not only be a big project on its own but also set a success story of how we can make arrangements for cost and benefit sharing in harnessing of our vast water resources.
Indian investors are already finding traction in investing on hydro projects in Nepal. Two large scale projects have been initiated – one by a public enterprise and the other by a private investor.
In order to facilitate cross border trade of electricity from projects like these, our two countries concluded a bilateral Power Trade Agreement in 2014 incorporating the provision about free trade of electricity. Power traders and developers are awaiting issuance of a facilitative procedures for cross border electricity trade.
Nepal’s desire is to see an early possibility of unhindered trade of electricity among at least the BBIN countries.
The importance of connectivity cannot be overemphasized. We need to further expand air connectivity, air routes and road and rail linkages. Added to these are railways, waterways and other components of cross-border transit, transport hardware and software.
Lately, we have made noticeable progress on some of our flagship connectivity projects. Our Prime Ministers inaugurated a year ago Motihari-Amlekhgunj Petroleum Products Pipeline, the first cross border pipeline in the region. We are talking about further expansion of pipeline infrastructure.
Integrated Check-posts have been developed and operationalized at two major border points streamlining the cross-border movement of goods. More such Check-posts are on the plan.
Progress has been made on cross border railways too. Required preparatory steps are being taken for the development of Kathmandu-Raxaul railway. Our experts have undertaken homework on inland waterways as well. These initiatives will not only make us more connected but also contribute to Nepal’s transformation from land-locked to land-linked situation.
Beyond the respective border, our two countries do share a dream of regional prosperity and better regional cooperation. We work together in SAARC, BIMSTEC and BBIN. Even during the Covid 19 pandemic, we explored the possibility of regional cooperation among the SAARC countries. We thank the Prime Minister of India for taking the initiative to convene the virtual summit of SAARC leaders.
In international forums, Nepal and India are both advocates of the issues uniquely faced by developing countries and do raise voice for a fairer and more inclusive global development architecture. We speak for a better level playing field for all countries.
Dear Friends, 
We are in the changed context both at home and abroad. Accordingly, we want to inject fresh perspectives into our relations with external world.
Our foreign policy priority begins at our borders. Talking about India, our intention is to strengthen the foundation of our relations; to expand and consolidate it; and to bring the relations to the next level. Our objective is clear and unambiguous.
We are two countries of different size, populations, level of economic development. The scope of our ambition is different, so is our strength. India is aspiring to be a global power, both politically and economically. Nepal’s ambition is to be a more stable and prosperous country.
As a close neighbour, we are delighted to see India’s incredible achievements: be it the infrastructure build-up or industrialization; be it the advancement in technology, or in terms of the seven decades of successful democratic practice.
Today as we wait for the availability of COVID 19 vaccines, India is one of the few front runners that have started vaccinating the people. This has given us a great hope. I take this opportunity to congratulate India and its innovative companies for the success. Being next door, we believe we too will be availing these vaccines.
Dear Friends,
Nepal was among the few countries that remained independent throughout its history. In this very fact is rooted the abounding sense of national pride of today’s 30 million Nepali people. We, therefore, hold dearer than anything else the principles of sovereign equality, mutual respect and non-interference.
We pursue an independent foreign policy and our conduct of external relations is based on a balanced outlook. We do not harbour ill-will against anyone. Amity with all and enmity with none is our motto. Guided by the same principles, we seek to foster relations with neighbours and all friendly countries around the world.
Prime Minister Oli said, while in this very city three years ago, that Nepal desired to create a strong edifice of trust in our relations; desired to create a relationship which would make our generation and the future equally proud. We want to see a 21st century Nepal-India relationship, which is forward looking and firmly founded on equality, mutual respect, justice and understanding of each other’s concerns and sensitivities.
For that, we should sincerely attend to the issues that we have inherited from the past; address them appropriately and should creatively work out the agendas for future. With the same objective, we created an Eminent Persons’ Group in 2016 and mandated them to review the entire spectrum of Nepal-India relations and recommend measures to upgrade them in the changed context. EPG has done its work and our job is to receive their report and implement.
One of the tasks assigned to EPG was the task of recommending the inputs for the review of past treaties and agreement, including the Peace and Friendship Treaty of 1950. We have agreed to revise, adjust and update the Treaty to better reflect the current reality and to further consolidate and expand our friendship. We need to do it sooner than later.
To conclude, our conviction is unwavering that Nepal-India friendship stands on a robust foundation. Our connection is deep and engagement comprehensive. Yet we should be mindful equally that healthy relations require continuous nurturing, creative thinking, promptness and readiness to understand each other in changing dynamics. I am sure we have that competence.
Thank you!

Address to the nation by the Rt. Hon. Prime Minister Mr. K P Sharma Oli
Posted onDecember 22, 2020December 22, 2020 

21 December 2020

Respected sisters and brothers,

None of us had any speculation that a situation of going to the people seeking their mandate a year and a half before the scheduled time would ever arise. The people’s verdict received through the elections of November/December 2017 was in favor of political stability. However, I was left without option but to go to the sovereign people after having been subjected to obstructions in national politics by dragging it endlessly in meaningless debate against the people’s mandate and aspiration; Parliament having been rendered unproductive; and popularly elected Government having been subjected to non-cooperation, opposition and siege. I, therefore, would like to submit to you that with a conclusion to present to the people, a decision was taken yesterday, 20 December 2020, to hold new elections in April/May 2021, after dissolving the House of Representatives.
In surface, the events that developed yesterday though may appear unexpected and sudden, the situation was the result of inconsistent and absurd activities against people’s expectations that were in play for long in the national politics, particularly from some leaders of Communist Party of Nepal (CPN). It was announced on 3 October 2017 that the then CPN (UML) and the CPN (Maoist-Centre) would participate jointly as a leftist alliance in the elections and would then be unified as a single party immediately after that. This decision was clearly endorsed by the people as a whole through the general elections. However, after the elections, different untoward activities began to appear not to allow the progress in national politics as defined by the people’s will. I think the then activities of initially delaying in the formation of the Government and obstructing the national politics with endless bargaining and pressures against people’s will must be fresh in your memory.
Clearing hurdles the Government was formed and commenced its work as per the people’s aspirations. What ensued were the perpetual messages and attempts for destabilization by some leaders. Just within a year after the formation of the Government, one of the leaders spread a message of instability while in abroad, and the other called for divers to save a ‘sinking country’ that too when the Prime Minister was outside the country. Whereas the Government was concentrated on the drafting of new laws for the implementation of the Constitution, rolling out of the federalism and the socio-economic transformation of the country. On the contrary, a number of colleagues were constantly eying on portfolios, honor and position. At the time of focusing all its efforts on policy, state affairs and public mobilization in order for shouldering the historic responsibility bestowed upon the NCP, a few leaders tried to hold the party hostage to their dissents, frustration and self-centered thoughts, thereby rendering the party ineffective.

Sisters and brothers,

It was expected that the decision of work division between the two Chairmen, one to concentrate to run the Government and the other to run the party, would solve the problem. Accordingly, I fully dedicated myself to the Government. I need not say anything, within this period, how much progress has been achieved on the party’s front; how much unfinished tasks of party unification has been completed; to what extent the preparations for the General Conventions have been made; and how have been the larger party rank and file mobilized when people faced problems. Facts speak for themselves. The Government, on the other hand, was not allowed to function smoothly. Attempts to reshuffle the cabinet of ministers on the basis of qualifications and caliber–who would be able to steer the party manifesto and campaign of ‘Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali’–were scuttled by creating divergence on the ground of favoritism. Important positions in the constitutional bodies began to remain vacant, which could not be fulfilled. Appointments to the bodies mandated by the Constitution to benefit backward social groups could not be made even in two and a half years. The Government has accomplished works of far-reaching importance, achievements have been made amid adversities, and epochal undertakings have been initiated. Despite this, some leaders continued endless castigation of the Government creating negative psychology, even going ahead of the opposition party. Various resolutions presented by the Government were forcefully stopped without providing an opportunity for the sovereign Parliament to deliberate on them. I do not think you are unaware, during the past few months how the Government was forced to work amidst adversities and victimized of encirclement.
I took an initiative to establish a legitimate system of hand-over of leadership in both the state system and the party structure. I tried to establish a method that Prime Minister would be chosen by the parliament made on the basis of people’s fresh mandate and the party leadership by the General Convention. I presented a roadmap for the transfer of nation’s leadership to the active new generation which can fulfill the ‘mission’ of socio-economic transformation, with a dignified role of patron and inspirer to the first-generation leaders who took the mantle of the federal democratic republic. Based on this assumption, I even announced handing over of responsibility to a well-qualified leader after completion of five years of leadership of the Government and retirement from the party’s executive role after the General Convention. I proposed the plan to hand over the position of Chairman even by holding a special convention, if regular general convention cannot take place in view of the complex situation facing the country. But friends could not wait even for four months of the General Convention. Instead, a letter of accusation was lodged in a sheer undignified way to assassinate my political character. The party’s logo and office were misused in distributing the same across the country, declaring indirectly the split of the party. Preparations for no-confidence motion against the Prime Minister were concurrently moved forward. Prior to that, collection of signatures requesting for summoning the parliamentary session was initiated without the knowledge of the Chairman and the leader of the parliamentary party, an act that runs against the Constitution and seriously damages the party, the system and methods. Following this the situation within the party has reached to a grave and disastrous state.
The day before yesterday, on 19 December 2020, I went to the residence of Mr. Pushpa Kamal Dahal with repeated requests to withdraw the divisive letter of allegations, create a comfortable and fair environment in the party and hand over the leadership by convening a special convention. I requested him time and again not to push the party towards a vote and not to derail from responsibilities against the party constitution and the spirit of unification through the committees formed by nominations for transitional purpose of party unification and main responsibility of holding General Convention. But these attempts were considered as my weakness. Obscuring as if nothing has happened and nothing serious would happen, preparations for no-confidence motion against the Prime Minister continued.

Sisters and brothers,

Was there a reasonable cause for besieging the Government and conspiring against it? In the meantime, the Government has performed historic tasks for strengthening national interests. A new map has been published comprising Nepal’s actual territory. Accordingly, the Constitution has been amended through a unanimous decision. Preparations for talks with the friendly country of India are being made to resolve the issue. The Transit Transport Protocol has been signed with China. There has been a rise in Nepal’s international image, role and attention. While cooperation from everyone was needed to strengthen it, isn’t it clear that serious conspiracy is behind all the acts of not cooperating and failing the Government at this moment?
Looking at these events, I recall the developments of four years ago. In return for facing courageously the blockade and ending it, and for ascertaining by expanding Nepal’s transit facilities that such an incidence would never happen, the incumbent Government had been overthrown deceitfully in the same manner. Circumstance and context was different but the actors were the same. Doesn’t it confirm that some of our leaders are involved in the plan to engulf Nepal in indefinite instability?



It has already been stated above that despite many adversities, Nepal has made notable achievements in the past three years. Nepal has progressed on most of the development indicators. In some areas, there has been leapfrogging. Peace and security situation has been strengthened. Separatists activities have been resolved. Should the party not be pleased by such situation wherein positive steps have been taken towards development, good governance, prosperity and stability in the country? Should we all not be together to add pace to this?
But action has been quite the opposite from some of the leaders. Instead of letting the government work for five years and following democratic path of getting the government’s performance tested by the people through election, politics was held hostage in the maze of power for ever, rule for ever and allotment of positions ever. In democracy, the ruling side functions as per people’s command while the opposition plays the role of check and balance. But in ours, an ironic situation was created, wherein some friends of the ruling side themselves became more aggressive and non-cooperative, and got involved in conspiring activities. We should be cognizant that in the unfolding of today’s situation, the activities of some of leaders are mainly responsible. Such way cannot be democratic by any measures.


Sisters and Brothers, 

Obstacles were continuously created in my efforts to steer ahead the party as united, establish norms and system for leadership transfer and orient the party, government and parliament towards people’s interest. Only after this, I was compelled to reach such decision. Dissolution of the House of Representatives and new election were not of my liking or choice. However, it would not have been appropriate to keep the country in a non-functioning condition. It would be against the mandate of the people to hold the parliament hostage of a few leaders’ self-interest. We should have to find a way out of the stalled situation in which work could not be done as per the will of the people. We had to end the situation in which its own leaders did not let the people-endorsed government of NCP and the House of Representative got victimized by squabble inside the party. Against this backdrop, I reached the conclusion for going to the sovereign people for a new mandate.
I still urge all Comrades to participate in the election as united forgetting the bitterness of the past. I have expected that the declaration of the election will boost up party unity. This will provide opportunity to test the popularity and competence of those Comrades who said: – in making the party number one force, its unification and in achieving the massive popular support, K P Oli has no contribution and we are the deciders. To the leaders who are eagerly waiting to be the Prime Minister or are making efforts to that end, the fresh mandate of the people will provide an option. This will also give an opportunity to the opposition party to carry its agenda to the people.
Election is the soul of democracy. This is also the best democratic exercise and process. If an elected government is not allowed to function, the sovereign people are the only place for appeal. I have adhered to the same path. The party fought under my leadership in the last election. I was unanimously elected as the Leader in the parliamentary party and in that capacity, was elected as the Prime Minister. When the consensus Leader of the party in majority was not allowed to function, I did not deem it appropriate to undermine people’s expectation by getting entangled with unprincipled and improper compromises inside a closed room. I considered it a democratic option to let the people decide. After all, I have always differed with the undemocratic tendency of entering into government through back door and making a mockery of people’s mandate.

Sisters and Brothers,

The Constitution of Nepal provides that the sovereignty and state authority of Nepal are vested in Nepali people. The ultimate decision makers in the management of the state are the people. This sovereignty, state authority and decision of people are expressed through election. Election that articulates the will of the people further strengthens democracy and makes it matured. Our democratic system is new, but not weak. The country is not in a situation without people’s representatives. The National Assembly is active. The provincial governments, provincial assemblies and local governments are providing political leadership at their respective levels in accordance with the Constitution and laws of the country. Institutions, including the President and the Judiciary, and all of the civil and security organs of the State are determined to carry out their duties. A new House of Representatives will be formed in four and a half months. Our young generation, which is ready to lead the 21st century, is committed to democracy. This generation is the strongest guardian of democracy. In this circumstance, I call on all the youths to be active by uniting themselves in defense of democracy. Therefore, the propaganda or suspicion that the Constitution will be in jeopardy, the democratic republic will be in crisis and the country will be pushed towards instability is baseless. The decisive factor in guaranteeing political stability is the will of the people.

Therefore, I urge everyone to focus on the preparation for the general election without getting bogged down by anything.
Thank you.

Remarks by Hon. Foreign Minister at HDR Launching
Posted onDecember 16, 2020December 16, 2020 

Remarks by Hon. Mr. Pradeep Kumar Gyawali, Minister for Foreign Affairs, at the launch of Human Development Report 2020, entitled “Human Development Report 2020: The Next Frontier: Human Development and the Anthropocene”
10:30 am – 12:30 pm, Wednesday, 16 December 2020
 
Hon. Krishna Prasad Oli, Member of the National Planning Commission
Dr. Yubraj Khatiwada, Former Minister for Finance
HE Nona Deprez, EU Ambassador
Dr Pema Gyamtsho, DG, ICIMOD
Mr. Yannick Glemarec, Executive Director, Global Climate Fund,
Ms. Ayshanie Labe, UNDP Resident Representative to Nepal,
Distinguished Panelists,
Ladies and Gentlemen.
 
 
Good afternoon and Namaskar to you all!
Let me first of all thank Ms. Ayshanie Labe, Resident Representative of UNDP in Nepal, for inviting me to this important ceremony of launching Human Development Report 2020.
For three decades, Human Development Reports have fundamentally shaped the ideas and policy discourse on alternative assessment of development and wellbeing. The criteria used for measuring human development have been the basis for advancing social development agenda, including in Nepal. The contents of the HDR reports have served as useful policy resources for many countries.
Successive human development reports since 1990 have highlighted critical dimensions of human progress and sustainable development, thereby informing, encouraging and assisting the Governments and stakeholders to address the impediments in the way of enlarging choices. They have also widened the conceptual foundation of human development as a capability to lead life one values the most.
Over the years, the very concept of human development has evolved and adapted considerably to encompass newer elements and dimensions that expands human wellbeing, freedoms, and choices. This year, the report heralds an epoch-making transformation that has taken place in the inter-relationship between human and nature, and signals humans’ entry into an uncharted territory of Anthropocene- where humans shape the future of the planet, not the other way round.
The concept of human development has been re-interpreted in the report to account the profound impact of climate change and environmental degradation that we have experienced. The report asserts that in this uncertain and challenging new phase, human development cannot be defined by ‘capability’ to expanding choices alone, but also by the ‘agency’ and ‘value’ – that is ability to participate in decision making and make the most desired choices.
The report talks appropriately on planetary imbalances and social imbalances , and calls for just transformation that extends human freedoms while easing planetary pressures and underlines the need for whole-of-society response.
Conceptually, it develops a new planetary-pressure-adjusted-human-development-index (PHDI) and gives HDI a new dimension of accounting the impact a country makes to the planet.
The report has evoked a transformative thought in the form of an era of Anthropocene that will most probably shape the development discourse for another several decades.
This comes at a time that the world just celebrated the 5th anniversary of the Paris Climate Accord. World leaders have pronounced higher national ambitions and reinforced their commitment to firmly implement the Accord. This might look merely a coincidence. However, given the level of climate urgency felt around the world, this human development report is a significant addition to alert against the insatiable human action.
We just heard comprehensive presentations and rich intellectual commentaries on the report and its content. I believe the report will continue to invite further stimulating deliberations as we go on.
Dear Friends,
Now, let me relate the alarm ringing in the report to the context of Nepal and how we consider we could address the situation.
We Nepalis are the followers of nature-friendly culture. Our culture and traditions have taught us to live in harmony with nature, which is Nepali way of life. We consider rivers, mountains, trees, ponds and lakes as sacred places and abode of deities. We want to link this cultural value for the conservation of nature, protection of environment and mitigating and adapting with the impact of climate change.
Nepal strongly supports the implementation of the Paris Agreement and the call to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees. Prime Minister Rt. Hon. Mr. K P Sharma Oli addressed the climate ambition summit hosted to mark the 5th anniversary of the Paris Agreement last week and outlined the roadmap for Nepal’s ambition towards a net-zero greenhouse gas emission by 2050. Coinciding this, Nepal submitted its updated, more ambitious and progressive Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC-2020).
We are committed to the promotion of climate-resilient development and aim to move towards a zero-carbon economy. We have prioritized producing clean and renewable energy as well as promoting e-mobility, low carbon infrastructure and ecotourism. By 2030, Nepal aims to maintain 45% of the country’s land under forest cover and aims to extend protected area from 23% to 30% and preserve biodiversity.
Nepal’s mountains are not only source of fresh water for millions, but also serve as climate stabilizer and help maintain ecological balance in the oceans.
While implementing the NDC, Nepal remains committed to prioritize the issue of gender equality and social inclusion and ensure full, equal and meaningful participation of women, children, youth, indigenous peoples and marginalized communities in all stages of the implementation process. I believe this is where we match with the emphasis of this year’s HDR on human ‘agency’ and ‘value’.
While easy and adequate access to climate finance becomes critical for us to implement these ambitions, we are keen to join hands with all countries to march ahead for a more sustainable journey together.
With a view to contribute in our own way to the climate change agenda, we are committed to host the Sagarmatha Sambad when the COVID-19 situation becomes normal.
Human development is a path that leads us to live a happy and meaningful life. In order to successfully navigate through the age of Anthropocene, we do not have a choice of continuing the business as usual. It is a call to pursue entirely a new path that all countries, societies and economies must adopt to save humanity from unforeseen crises and dooms.
The most reassuring path is deploying sustained action through mechanisms of social norms and values, incentives and regulations, and nature based human development. Without this, we cannot address the most critical challenges of Anthropocene- mitigating and adapting to climate change, protecting biodiversity and ensuring human wellbeing for all.
Before conclude, I would like to quote Nobel laureate Pablo Neruda, ‘The bare earth, plantless, waterless, is an immense puzzle. In the forests or beside rivers everything speaks to humans. The desert does not speak. I could not comprehend its tongue; its silence…’
I believe, this report in the 30th year of HDR, will mark a paradigm shift in terms of new development thought, process and action for promoting sustainable human development in an extraordinary time that we are living in.
I thank you.

Statement by Prime Minister of Nepal Rt. Hon. Mr. K P Sharma Oli at the ‘31st Special Session of the UN General Assembly in Response to COVID-19 Pandemic’
3 December 2020, New York
Mr. President
Mr. Secretary-General
Excellencies, and 
Distinguished Delegates. 
I thank you, Mr. President, for convening the Special Session on COVID-19 Pandemic.
With its unprecedented scope and speed, the pandemic has affected everyone, everywhere. The tragedy is unspeakable, with over 1.3 million lives lost and almost all societies, economies, and nations severely suffered.
The present pandemic is not just a health emergency. It is a wake-up call against the widening inequality among and within the nations and humanity’s failure to live in harmony with nature.
Yes, we all are in the same firestorm. Some of us may think that we are well protected, but it is not so. All of are in danger.
The pandemic has taught us a precious lesson. This world is a small boat, we all are its passengers. We like it or not, we share the same fate.
Mr. President,
Like any other countries, Nepal was not prepared for the crisis of this scale.
However, we have deployed all political, economic, human, and technological resources at our disposal to contain the virus.
We are guided primarily by the three objectives of strengthening of health care system; protecting people’s lives; and building a sustainable and resilient recovery.
Testing and treatment services are provided free of charge to the needy people. Necessary infrastructures, human and financial resources, and medical equipment are ensured to the health systems in federal, provincial, and local levels.
Beginning from almost none, we extended PCR testing facility to 68 laboratories across the country. More than 70 hospitals have been designated as COVID-19 hospitals. We are moving ahead with the target of building hospitals with basic health care facilities in all 753 Local Levels.
We developed total 48 sets of COVID-19 related Protocols and Guidelines.
Raising public awareness about health protocols, safety and sanitization through social organizations, individuals, mass media, social media and daily briefing by the Health Ministry have been particularly useful.
Mr. President,
Nepal commends the United Nations, and in particular the WHO, for their global coordination and leadership during the crisis.
While we confront the challenges, a robust global response is a must to fend off this crisis.
First and foremost, we must give a fresh lease of life to multilateralism.
We need a revitalized multilateralism that is capable of tackling pressing challenges of our time, from poverty, hunger and rising inequality to climate crisis and global pandemic.
For this, we must choose a path of cooperation and solidarity, not solitary action.
Second, the pandemic should not be used as a pretext for backtracking from international solidarity and commitments. Countries in special situation stand in need of greater support to stabilize their economy, safeguard fiscal space, and tackle debt crisis.
Third, while we are encouraged by the good news about vaccine, uncertainty looms large if this will be available for all. We commend the initiative of COVAX to ensure access to vaccines to all- the rich and poor.
The world will not be safe from the pandemic unless universal coverage of vaccine is ensured.
When the entire humanity is in crisis, we strongly believe that life-saving vaccines cannot be the means of maximizing profit. They must be truly global public goods affordable and accessible to all countries and all people.
Finally, as we look to recover and rebuild better, our efforts must be aligned with the 2030 Agenda and the Paris Agreement. We must invest in health and social protection systems; invest in infrastructure and create jobs.
National endeavors in this regard must be complemented by international support measures.
The present crisis demands a genuine commitment to save lives and global unity to protect societies. Human civilizations have always endured devastating challenges and recovered better.
We must not falter. We must act now, and act as one community, one civilization and one world.
We must rebound better than ever leaving no one behind.
Thank you.

Virtual Ministerial Meeting of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) at the Margins of the 75th Session of the United Nations General Assembly
09 October 2020
Theme: Bandung+65: More Relevant, United and Effective NAM against Emerging Global Challenge Including COVID-19
Mr. Chairman
Excellencies,
Distinguished delegates.
I would like to begin by thanking the Republic of Azerbaijan, the Chair of the Non-aligned Movement, for convening this Meeting.
We appreciate Azerbaijan’s dynamic leadership provided to our movement during these difficult times.
The Online Summit of the NAM Task Force held in May 2020 was a worthy initiative in mustering international support against the COVID-19.
We are confident that the 31st Special Session of the UNGA being convened at the request of the NAM will be able to garner wider international support, solidarity and commitment to fight this pandemic.
Mr. Chairman,
Sixty-five years ago, 29 Asian African countries, including my own country Nepal, assembled in Bandung with the shared aspiration of peace, prosperity, harmony and justice.
The leaders stood for equality among nations, respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, non-interference and economic cooperation.
They advocated for human rights and prosperity for all.
And, more importantly, they called for addressing global challenges and crises through cooperation and collaboration.
The ten Principles enunciated in the Bandung Declaration laid the foundation of Non-aligned Movement.
Adopted at the backdrop of complex international geo-politics, these principles are time-tested and stand relevant. They bear even greater meaning today when the very foundation of cooperative global order confronts with parochial nationalism and the return of geopolitics.
The challenges posed by COVID-19 and its impacts on the poorest and most vulnerable people calls for greater international collaboration and support. The pandemic has taught us that no country- whether big or small- is immune from the challenges of global proportion.
Effective and coordinated efforts are needed to address the current and emerging challenges and emergencies. Only through larger international collaboration and synergy we can win the pandemic. United we stand stronger, divided we will fail, and the virus will win.
Therefore, this is not a time to abdicate from international responsibility and resort to self-centered nationalism. This is a time to internalize the cost of discord and benefit of cooperation, strengthen multilateral institutions and promote multilateralism with the United Nations at its centre.
We must retain the spirit of solidarity and cooperation. This is the only way where all nations large or small can coexist in peace and dignity.
With its numerical and moral strength, NAM should claim its rightful place and amplify the voice of the weak and vulnerable countries in their fight against the pandemic. NAM must prove itself as a collective voice of reason and a source of strength to its membership.
For this, we the member states of NAM, need to recommit ourselves to make the Movement more effective and faithfully adhere to its principles.
The current crisis requires investing in health systems, social protection and poverty reduction; removing of trade barriers; and accelerating of efforts to address the climate crisis. NAM has to take a leadership role in these areas.
The challenges confronted by the LDCs, LLDCs, and SIDS are unique and different. They require robust support measures in the form of preferential trade, investment, technology and knowledge transfer and development cooperation. This has become even more important in the face of the present global health crisis and resulting economic downturn.
With only one decade left to achieve the 2030 Agenda, we must accelerate its implementation and build sustainable and resilient pathways to address the long-term developmental consequences of COVID-19.
In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, I reaffirm Nepal’s profound commitment to the principles of NAM and pledge our continued cooperation to its processes and initiatives.
I thank you.

Statement by Prime Minister of Nepal Rt. Hon. Mr. K P Sharma Oli at the Virtual Climate Vulnerable Forum Leaders Event Organized in Conjunction with the 75th Session of United Nations General Assembly 2020
07 October 2020
Madam Chair, Your Excellency Sheikh Hasina, the Prime Minister of Bangladesh,
Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen.
I begin by congratulating Bangladesh for assuming the Chairmanship of the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF) and coordinating this important event.
Climate change today poses an existential threat. The best available science tells us that with rising temperature, rising sea levels, and melting glaciers, humanity is on the wrong side of the race against nature.
Retreat of the glacial ice due to global warming has negatively impacted the lives and livelihoods of the Himalayan and high mountain civilization, induced disasters in the lowlands and caused rise of the ocean levels.
Nepal’s snow-fed rivers nourish the basins and ultimately help cleaning of the ocean ecosystems. They serve as natural climate stabilizer signifying the organic linkage between mountains and the oceans.
It is ironic that the climate vulnerable countries like ours have borne the brunt of inaction of others.
The impacts of climate change do not respect political boundaries. Therefore, the vision set by the CVF for increased commitment by all nations to limit the rise of global temperature to 1.5°C is now more important than ever.
The inception of ‘Survival Deadline’ today highlights the urgency of climate action.
The large emitters should break their silence and scale up climate ambitions to send a strong signal.
This is a time to walk the talk.
It is a time to inspire others by example with full and effective implementation of the Paris Agreement.
For us, every year counts and reducing every fraction of a degree in temperature matters.
It is a question of survival for the vulnerable countries.
CVF has always been on a frontline with good track record to lead the long term sustainable solution to climate change. It is important to keep the climate issues at the top of global political agenda as we prepare for COP 26 next year.
Nepal remains committed to communicate enhanced Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) by the end of this year.
Climate action for the vulnerable countries like us rests in access to climate financing, affordable technology, and implementable adaptation and mitigation programs.
Excellencies,
The COVID-19 crisis has devastated human lives and economies.
But, the pandemic can be an opportunity for a greener and more sustainable health and economies. The lesson learnt can be useful to tackle climate change with the similar sense of urgency and priority at national, regional and international levels.
The need is to tread on the right path.
The need is to unite for climate actions, not to pitch politics against climate change.
The need is to have a common plan- the plan of sustainable solutions.
There is no time to lose.
Action must start now, as this is a question of our survival.
I thank you!

Statement by Minister for Foreign Affairs Honourable Mr. Pradeep Kumar Gyawali at Event to Commemorate the International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons
Friday, 2 October 2020
Mr. President,
Excellencies,
Distinguished delegates.
At the outset, I would like to thank you, Mr. President, for convening this event to commemorate the international day for the total elimination of nuclear weapons.
We are living in unprecedented times. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused disruptions in lives, livelihoods, and economies.
However, the pandemic has taught us an important lesson that human lives are more precious than anything else.
In nine months, we have lost over a million lives to the pandemic. But, we can lose more lives within a wink of an eye in case of a nuclear explosion- whether accidental or intentional.
The scientific race for vaccines has kept our hope alive to win the war against this virus. But no vaccine would save us from the nuclear catastrophe. Death, destruction, and devastation would be much more severe, inhumane, and indiscriminate- both for the present and future generations.
Despite this, it is ironic that huge amount is spent on nuclear weapons every year, which is much higher than official development assistance to the neediest and poorest countries.
It is time to reflect on where our investment should be:
– On nuclear weapons or poverty reduction?
– On eternal annihilation or environmental conservation?
Answer to these questions is plain and simple. We need to focus on the security and wellbeing of our people and humanity at large.
The dividend of disarmament should be diverted to achieving SDGs.
A small fraction of the costs of armament could save millions from hunger and disease; and can supply safe drinking water and basic health services.
More diplomatic efforts can be devoted to the protection of environment, trade promotion, and economic development if we all abide by nuclear disarmament regimes including NPT, CTBT, and TPNW.
To conclude, Mr. President, I reaffirm Nepal’s principled position that universal peace and security can only be ensured through a time-bound, general and complete disarmament of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction.
Nepal believes that the peaceful use of nuclear energy and the complete disarmament of nuclear weapons are two sides of the same coin.
Nuclear technology should be harnessed for peaceful purposes of promoting health care, increasing agricultural productivity and saving lives.
The world will never be a safer place as long as specter of nuclear weapons looms large.
Thank you.

Statement by the President of Nepal, Right Honourable Mrs. Bidya Devi Bhandari, at the High-level Meeting on the Twenty-Fifth Anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women (Beijing+25)
New York, 1 October 2020
Theme: Accelerating the realization of gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls
Mr. President,
Excellency the Secretary General of the United Nations,
Distinguished Delegates
I begin by thanking you, Mr. President, for convening this historic meeting to mark the Twenty-fifth Anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women.
Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action serves as a transformative blueprint for gender equality and empowerment of women and girls.
Despite a steady progress achieved in twelve critical areas of Beijing Declaration, it will take time to fully realize those commitments.
Structural gaps and challenges still persist in society.
COVID-19 pandemic has risked further aggravating inequalities.
We should not let the pandemic stall our progress.
Ensuring timely medical care, equal access to vaccines and robust recovery plans that take care of the economic and social needs of women and girls are necessary.
This will be a test for the decade of action on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and achieving of the SDG 5.
Nepal is a state party to major human rights instruments including the CEDAW.
We have mainstreamed gender agenda as an integral part of national development by integrating them in the Constitution and laws.
We have strengthened law enforcement and implemented targeted interventions to end gender-based violence and discrimination.
Free air evacuation services have been provided to save the lives of the women from the remotest part of the country suffering from pregnancy and maternity-related complications.
At present, women occupy 41 percent of elected offices in federal, provincial and local governments and over 24 percent in civil service. Total 83 percent of women in Nepal are in labour force.
These achievements are attained through long struggle and persistent constructive efforts.
We can achieve the objectives of the Beijing Declaration by removing gender stereotypes, rectifying long-standing inequalities and matching our commitments with action at national, regional and international levels.
The movement of women’s empowerment must continue till we achieve full and substantive equality.
We remain committed to eliminate remnants of discrimination and plug the implementation gaps.
Excellencies,
To conclude, I would like to emphasize that gender equality is essential and important right for the continuity of life and the world.
It is the only path to justice, peace, and progress.
This historic occasion is an opportunity to reaffirm our resolve to end barriers in the way of realizing all inherent potentials of women.
Thank you.

न्यूर्योक, १ अक्टोबर २०२०
मूल नारा: “सबै महिला, किशोरी तथा बालिकाहरूलार्इ सशक्त बनार्इ लैङ्गिक समानताको गति तीब्र बनाऔं”
अध्यक्ष महोदय,
संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघका महामहिम महासचिव ,
विशिष्ट महानुभावहरु ।
महिलासम्बन्धी चौथो विश्व सम्मेलनको पच्चीसौं वार्षिकोत्सवको अवसरमा यो उच्चस्तरीय बैठक आयोजना गर्नुभएकोमा म अध्यक्ष महोदय प्रति हार्दिक धन्यवाद् व्यक्त गर्दछु ।
बेइजिङ घोषणापत्र तथा कार्ययोजनाले महिला, किशोरी तथा बालिकाहरूको समानता र सशक्तिकरणका लागि रुपान्तरणकारी खाका प्रदान गरेको छ ।
बेइजिङ घोषणापत्रमा अन्तरनिहित सरोकारका बाह्र क्षेत्रहरूमा क्रमिक रूपमा प्रगति हुँदै गएको भएपनि ती प्रतिबद्धताहरु पूर्ण रुपमा हासिल हुन अझै समय लाग्ने छ। समाजमा संरचनागत खाडल तथा चुनौतिहरु कायमै छन् ।
कोभिड-१९ को महामारीले असमानताको जोखिमलार्इ अझ बढाएको छ । यो महामारीलार्इ हाम्रो प्रगतिको बाधक बन्न दिनु हुँदैन।
समयमै स्वास्थ्य स्याहार, खोपमा समान पहुँच एवम् महिला, किशोरी तथा बालिकाहरुको आर्थिक तथा सामाजिक आवश्यकताहरू सम्बोधन गर्न पुर्नलाभका योजना जरूरी छन् ।
‘दिगो विकास कार्यसूची २०३०’ को कार्यान्वयन दशक एवम् दिगो विकासको पाँचौं लक्ष्य प्राप्तिका लागि त यो एक महत्वपूर्ण परीक्षण नै हुनेछ ।
नेपाल सिड (CEDAW) लगायत मानव अधिकार सम्बन्धी प्रमुख दस्तावेजहरुको पक्षराष्ट्र रहेको छ। हामीले लैङ्गिक मुद्दालार्इ राष्ट्रिय विकासको अभिन्न अंगको रुपमा संविधान एवं कनुनमा नै व्यवस्थित गरेका छौं ।

भौगोलिक रुपम विकटतम् क्षेत्रमा रहेका प्रसव वेदनामा छटपटाएका गर्भवती र सुत्केरी महिलको जिवन रक्षाका लागि हवार्इ उद्धारको व्यवस्था गरिएको छ ।
वर्तमान समयमा नेपालमा संघ, प्रदेश र स्थानीय सरकारका कूल निर्वाचित पदमध्ये ४१ प्रतिशत र निजामती सेवामा २४ प्रतिशतभन्दा बढी महिला कार्यरत छन् भने ८३ प्रतिशत महिलाहरु श्रम बजारका विभिन्न क्षेत्रमा संलग्न छन् ।
यी उपलब्धिहरु लामो संघर्ष र निरन्तरको सृजनात्मक प्रयासबाट प्राप्त भएका हुन् ।
लैङ्गिक रुढीवादलार्इ हटाएर, परम्परादेखि चल्दै आएका असमानतालार्इ सच्याएर एवम् राष्ट्रिय, क्षेत्रीय तथा अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय स्तरमा हाम्रा प्रतिबद्धताहरू र तिनको कार्यान्वयन बीच समन्वय कायम गरेर बेइजीङ्ग घोषणापत्रका उद्देश्यहरु हासिल गर्न सकिनेछ ।
पूर्ण एवम् सारभूत समानता हासिल नभएसम्म महिला शसक्तिकरणको अभियान जारी रहनु पर्दछ ।
विभेदका अवशेषहरू निर्मूल पार्न र कार्यान्वयनमा रहेका कमजोरीलार्इ सुधार्न हामी प्रतिबद्ध रहेका छौं ।
महामहिमज्यूहरु,
अन्त्यमा, लैङ्गिक समानता जीवन र जगतको निरन्तरताको लागि अपरिहार्य र महत्वपूर्ण अधिकार हो भन्ने कुरामा म जोड दिन चाहन्छु ।
यो न्याय, शान्ति एवम् प्रगतिको एकमात्र मार्ग हो ।
आजको यो ऐतिहासिक क्षण महिलामा अन्तरनिहित सबै संभावनाहरु हासिल गर्ने मार्गमा रहेका अवरोध अन्त्यको संकल्प गर्ने अवसर पनि हो ।
धन्यवाद ।

Statement by Rt. Hon. Mr. K P Sharma Oli, Prime Minister of Nepal, at the Biodiversity Summit during the 75th United Nations General Assembly
30 September 2020
Theme: ‘Urgent Action on Biodiversity for Sustainable Development’ 
Mr. President,
Excellencies the Heads of State and Government,
Mr. Secretary-General,
Distinguished delegates.
I begin by thanking the Secretary General of the United Nations for convening this important summit.
Biodiversity resources are a lifeline for us. They provide fresh air, clean water, food and livelihood, mineral and medicine, and help sustain human life and economy.
Biodiversity connects generations and surpasses national boundaries.
Living in harmony with nature is part of Nepali culture.
Our ancient sages and saints have passed down valuable knowledge of biodiversity and taught us the value of its conservation.
Therefore, Nepal accords high priority to biodiversity conservation and has made a good progress.
Protecting biodiversity constitutes a critical component of our national aspiration of “Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali”.
Twenty-three percent of our geography has been designated as protected area and we have achieved Aichi Target – 11. We now plan to expand it to 30 percent by 2030.
Nepal’s progress in landscape level conservation and trans-boundary cooperation on migratory species are considered as success stories. So is the engaging of communities to managing human–wildlife conflict.
Availability of clean energy from hydro-electricity has reduced stress on biodiversity.
Through strong law enforcement system and enhanced cooperation at international level, we have achieved zero-poaching of rhino for almost a decade.
We have almost doubled the number of tigers well ahead of the target year of 2022.
The world can learn from our experience.
Excellencies,
Nepal’s mountain ecosystem is unique laboratory and true source of knowledge to inquisitive scholars, researchers and scientists. Mountain ecosystems make critical common property resources for the benefit of humanity which extends beyond our borders.
Human encroachment, pollution, climate change and wildlife crime all have negative impacts on biodiversity.
It is a multi-stakeholder business that requires commitment and action from all actors nationally and internationally.
We need to set more ambitious targets with a right balance of people’s right over natural resources and its sustainable protection.
We also need sustained investment in biodiversity conservation.
Implementing urgent climate action is a moral obligation. We need to harmonize the efforts under multilateral agreements and internationally agreed development frameworks.
Let us stand united, save this beautiful planet forever for our posterity. We have no right to compromise their future. Let us make it more habitable than today.
Let us muster requisite political will, promote ideas and innovations and act robustly to conserve biodiversity.
Thank you !

Statement by Prime Minister of Nepal Rt. Hon. Mr. K P Sharma Oli on behalf of the Group of the Landlocked Developing Countries at the High-level Meeting on Financing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in the Era of COVID-19 and Beyond
29 September 2020, New York, (Virtual Platform)
Right Honourable Prime Ministers of Canada and Jamaica,
Mr. Secretary-General
Excellencies,
Ladies and gentlemen,
On behalf of the Group of 32 Landlocked Developing Countries (LLDCs), I commend the Governments of Canada and Jamaica as well as the United Nations Secretary-General for convening this High-level Meeting.
We welcome the timely initiative for coordinated and multilateral efforts on Financing for Development in the Era of COVID-19 and Beyond launched on 28th May 2020.
The COVID-19 pandemic has put public health systems and our economies under stress. It has severely impacted people’s lives and livelihoods.
While the developed countries have undertaken the unprecedented fiscal and monetary policy measures to save their economies from the crisis, the policy response in many developing countries, especially in the most vulnerable like LDCs, LLDCs and SIDS have been weaker because of decline in trade and tourism earnings, reduced FDI, and servicing of external debts amid plunging foreign exchange inflows.
On behalf of the LLDC group, I wish to extend our support to the options outlined in the documents before us and, in particular, call for the concerted actions in the following areas:
First, we urgently need the suggested global coordination and cooperation mechanism for joint trade and investment promotion for crisis-relief. Such mechanism should give priority to the special needs of the LLDCs that require capacity development to harness trade, achieve structural economic transformation and to realize the SDGs.
Second, financial support to LLDCs is critical to boost up the urgently needed resilient infrastructure and trade facilitation mechanisms for smooth flow of goods which are key to their recovery.
Third, LLDCs need to be supported in their efforts to achieve digital transformation.
Fourth, we call on the international community to support development of strong and resilient health systems, underpinned by universal health coverage, that focus on equitable access, quality and financial protection, and easy and affordable access to vaccines once they are released.
Fifth, concrete support measures should be put in place to address debt vulnerabilities including through debt cancellation for highly indebted countries, debt relief by international creditors, exchange or reprofile debt to reduce debt service, writing-off debt, debt swaps for highly indebted countries, debt buy-backs and support market access.
Sixth, we call on our development partners to maintain current official development assistance levels given its crucial importance to support our countries to recover sustainably. Among the LLDCs, the financial gap to implement the SDGs appears more acute in the LDCs. They need predictable external support measures in the form of aid, investment, technology innovation, development and transfer.
Seventh, we call on International Financial Institutions to prioritize the special needs of the LLDCs in their recovery efforts.
Eighth, we request the UN system and other international and regional organizations to give priority support to the LLDCs’ recovery efforts – including the effective execution of Roadmap for accelerated implementation of the Vienna Programme of Action.
Finally, we call on the private sector to actively engage in the recovery efforts, particularly in sustainable development projects, including through the PPPs.
To conclude, let me reiterate the unfailing support of the LLDC Member States in implementing the global development agenda.
I thank you.

Address by Rt. Honorable Mr. K P Sharma Oli, Prime Minister of Nepal, to the High-level Virtual Side Event at the UN General Assembly on “Poverty at Crossroad: Using Leadership and the Multidimensional Poverty Indexes to Build Back Better”
24 September 2020 (9:00 New York)
Excellencies the Heads of State and Government,
Ladies and Gentlemen.
I commend the Government of Chile, MPPN and OPHI for hosting this event.
As we begin the decade of implementation of the Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development, progress in poverty reduction should be a primary indicator of assessing our overall performance.
The Constitution of Nepal enshrines several indicators of multiple poverty as fundamental rights of the citizen that include right to food, right to basic education and primary health care, right to clean water and sanitation, right to decent housing, and right to social protection. The constitution guides us to strive for establishing an egalitarian society. Our economic policies are aimed at promoting economic growth with equity and social justice.
Our goal is to end all forms of discrimination, deprivation and improve the quality of lives of our people. We are committed to ensure that ‘no one remains hungry, and no one dies of hunger’. We also aim at securing human security as early as possible to end all forms of poverty in the country.
We have implemented targeted programs to reducing poverty, illiteracy, unemployment and improving delivery of essential services. Education is compulsory up to basic level and free up to secondary level. Primary health care is free for all citizen. Subsidized health insurance scheme has covered a large section of people. Insurance against Covid-19 is also in implementation.
Universal access to renewable energy, basic water supply and sanitation is being achieved soon. Safe and decent housing schemes of the government is offering better housing facility for the poor. More than one third of the people are covered by one type of social protection or the other.
Income generating activities through government targeted programs, micro finance services, and interventions of cooperative and community organizations have been successful to reduce absolute poverty more than one percentage point every year for some years now. All these have contributed for overall reduction of poverty and improvement in human development indices.
Overall, we have institutionalized our approach of looking at poverty through the prism of more than absolute income. Considering poverty as a multidimensional phenomenon, we have considered both the monetary and non-monetary aspects of poverty in our national development strategy.
In partnership with OPHI, Nepal published first Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) in 2018. The report identified that the incidence of multidimensional poverty in Nepal has declined by half from 59% in 2006 to 29% in 2014.
The two indicators- nutrition and schooling- in which we were lagging behind have received renewed priority.
Nepal will release updated second report of National MPI within this year reflecting the status as of 2018-19. By aligning with the SDGs, we have set a target of reducing MPI to 11.5% by the end of 2024.
To complement this endeavor, Nepal has undertaken series of Living Standards Survey, Multiple Indicators Cluster Survey, and Demographic Health Survey for monitoring both the monetary and non-monetary measures of poverty. The 12th round of the decennial population census in 2021 will add significant value in this process.
Investing in people and preventing them from re-lapsing into poverty remains the key challenge. In devising appropriate policies, credible MPI data would provide a useful base. However, in a country of diverse geographical, social, economic and cultural conditions like Nepal, we must generate MPI at a much disaggregated level so that resources could be judicially allocated to reduce inequality and meet our aspiration of ‘Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali’ along with eliminating all kinds of inequality.
The COVID pandemic has severely impacted our effort to end absolute poverty and move to reducing all other forms of poverty as soon as possible. We have been making best efforts to protect lives of our citizen against both the health and economic threats posed by the pandemic. I firmly believe that with sincere national endeavor and larger global development cooperation and dedicated support measures, we can overcome this pandemic, achieve economic recovery and move to the path of speedy development.
It is high time that States reorient economic priorities and re-allocate resources for building and maintaining of basic social protection, health care and education.
Thank you.

National Statement by H. E. Mr. Shanker Das Bairagi, Foreign Secretary of Nepal at the Informal Meeting of the SAARC Council of Ministers (Virtual)
Kathmandu, 24 September 2020
Chairperson Hon. Minister for Foreign Affairs of Nepal
Hon’ble Ministers
His Excellency the Secretary General of SAARC
Distinguished Colleagues,
Good afternoon and Namaste!
I feel honored to deliver the country statement of Nepal in this august Council.
At the outset, I would like to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Esala R. Weerakoon on his assumption of office of the Secretary General of SAARC in March this year. Nepal will extend all cooperation to you in fulfilling your important responsibility.
I also thank the Secretary General for presenting the report highlighting the progress made since the Council met last year in New York, and for preparing the documents as well as for the excellent coordination of this meeting.
I would like to commend the former Secretary General His Excellency Mr. Amjad Hussain B. Sial for his able leadership and contribution to the SAARC process.
Excellencies,
The SAARC region is also facing severe impacts of Covid-19 pandemic. We are confronting one of the serious health challenges of our time. Beyond its severe impact on people’s health, it has halted business ventures, trade and commerce, construction works, and the social life. The working class is the hardest hit. Thousands of youths have lost their jobs. Millions of school children miss the learning opportunity.
The pandemic tends to reverse our hard-earned development gains, and the progress made on poverty alleviation.
The Government of Nepal has been taking all measures for the prevention and control of the pandemic in line with our policy of “protecting the lives of the people first”.
The Government has announced the ‘Healthy Nepal Campaign’ to actively prevent and control the pandemic. Under the campaign, we mobilize doctors and health workers, security personnel, civil servants, people’s representatives, experts, youth wings of political parties, and general people.
Beginning with no testing facility in the country, we have significantly improved our healthcare infrastructure.
Protecting the life of people from disease and hunger has remained our top priority. We have provided immediate relief and financial as well as policy incentives to the affected sectors of the economy to create a conducive environment for industries to resume economic activities.
The SAARC Leader’s Video Conference hosted by Hon. Prime Minister of India Shri Narendra Modi remained vital to advance our efforts to collectively combat the pandemic in South Asia. The Rt. Hon. Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli participated in the Conference. At the conference, SAARC Leaders agreed to create a Covid-19 Emergency Fund with the voluntary contributions from the Member States to address the pandemic.Nepal instantly joined the initiative. The video Conference was followed by other SAARC level meetings.
We are grateful to the neighboring and friendly countries, including the SAARC Member States, for their generous support and cooperation in our fight against the pandemic.
Finding a vaccine or permanent medical solution is critical to boost people’s confidence and regain momentum in the economy. We would like to stress that there should be universal access to the vaccine at an affordable price, once it is developed. The Covid-19 has underlined the urgent need for a meaningful regional cooperation in our region.
Excellencies,
Let me briefly touch upon the activities since the Council met in New York in September 2019.
Nepal hosted the 13th South Asian Games in December 2019, in Kathmandu, Pokhara and Janakpur. The Rt. Hon. President Bidya Devi Bhandari inaugurated the SAG on 1st December 2019. Over 2700 athletes competed at the regional sporting event. The event contributed to promoting the ties of friendship, goodwill, and solidarity among the peoples of South Asia.
Nepal hosted the 6th Meeting of SAARC Inter-Governmental Group on Transport (IGGT) on 19 November 2019 in Kathmandu to finalize the texts of the draft Motor Vehicles and Railways Agreements.
The Government of Nepal is planning to host the SAARC Education Minister’s Meeting virtually in a near future.
Excellencies,
Regional cooperation features prominently in Nepal’s foreign policy. We have always upheld the SAARC Charter. We believe, SAARC can be an effective vehicle for delivering development and prosperity in the region.
Meaningful cooperation in the areas of trade, transport, connectivity, energy, finance, investment, education, people-to-people contacts, and health, including in fighting the Covid-19 pandemic, would contribute to the realization of broader objectives of SAARC. While we have made some progress in widening the process of regional cooperation meaningful deepening is yet to take place.
During the 18th SAARC Summit held in Kathmandu in November 2014, we stressed the need to reinvigorate and revitalize the SAARC as an effective vehicle to fulfill the development aspirations of the peoples of South Asia.
However, the momentum has been slowed down. The postponements and delays in holding the meetings of the Charter bodies and other SAARC mechanisms have affected its effectiveness and overall performance.
Most importantly, holding the 19th SAARC Summit has been stalled for a long. The Meetings of the SAARC Council of Ministers and Standing Committee also remain pending since 2016.
We believe that the formal mechanisms of SAARC must function properly. The early holding of the 19th Summit has become imperative to further the SAARC process. We hope that the Council will make an appropriate decision on this vital matter.
Thank you !

Opening Remarks by Hon. Mr. Pradeep Kumar Gyawali, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Nepal (Chairperson) at the
Virtual Informal Meeting of the SAARC Council of Ministers
Kathmandu, 24 September 2020
Hon. Ministers for Foreign/External Affairs of SAARC Member States,
Heads of Delegation,
Foreign Secretaries,
His Excellency the Secretary General of SAARC,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Good afternoon and Namaste!
I am pleased to welcome you all in today’s Virtual Informal Meeting of the SAARC Council of Ministers. I wish to express my sincere thanks to Your Excellencies and the distinguished Heads of Delegations for being able to join this meeting this today. I look forward to having a constructive deliberation on the agenda items before us. I am confident that with our collective efforts we will come up with some tangible takeaways from this meeting. Needless to say, this is a forum where we discuss common regional issues by remaining within the parameters outlined by the SAARC Charter.
I also take this opportunity to welcome His Excellency Mr. Esala Weerakoon, Secretary-General of SAARC and commend him and his team for making excellent preparation for this meeting.
Excellencies,
SAARC has made a long journey since its inception in 1985. An effective, efficient, and result-oriented SAARC capable of bringing visible changes in the life of the peoples has always been our aspiration.
In the last 35 years, we have achieved some important milestones in key areas. We have created institutional and legal frameworks, intensified our efforts in such areas as alleviating poverty, reducing inequality, promoting trade and commerce, expanding connectivity, deepening people-to-people contacts, and expanding contacts with external organization having similar objectives and purposes.
The progress report of the Secretary General suggests that we need to do more to tackle both the traditional and emerging challenges facing the region through deeper and meaningful cooperation.
Excellencies,
The Covid-19 pandemic has been shaking every foundation of development and deeply impacting humanity in our region and all over the world. We have seen the fallouts of Covid-19 in our economy, in our education system, in our social life and people’s livelihood. The number of infected cases is on the rise.
Shrinking revenue, rising public expenditure, and increasing unemployment will further aggravate the situation in the coming days. Covid-19 is going to pose a serious security threat to the wellbeing of millions of people in South Asia.
The SAARC Leaders’ Video Conference hosted by Prime Minister of India His Excellency Shri Narendra Modi on 15 March 2020 remained instrumental in forging regional partnership to fight the pandemic.
In these trying times, it is vital to expand connectivity and ensure smooth supply of essential medicines and medical equipment. Sharing of knowledge, experience, technology and best practices could help develop resilience and to fight the pandemic collectively.
Excellencies,
During the 18th SAARC Summit held in 2014 in Kathmandu we agreed to hold the meetings of the Charter bodies regularly.
The delay in convening the 19th SAARC Summit and the absence of formal meetings of the SAARC Charter bodies since 2016, has greatly impacted the functioning of our organization. Consequently, key regional arrangements and instruments, and important undertakings and activities have been on hold for a long time. This has raised a serious question about the relevancy of the regional cooperation process that our leaders so thoughtfully launched and nurtured. We need to explore all viable options to generate the momentum and dynamism in SAARC. It is incumbent upon us to work towards creating an environment conducive to hold the Summit and other Charter body meetings.
The trading arrangements like SAFTA and SATIS are yet to come into full operation. Despite many commonalities in terms of geography, history, civilization, and culture, we remain one of the least integrated regions in trade and connectivity compared to other regions. We need to enhance our cooperation in the core areas of trade, investment, agriculture, energy, connectivity, and climate change.
Excellencies,
Nepal is fully committed to advancing the SAARC process forward in a spirit of unity and solidarity among fellow member states. Given the huge potentials in the region, we need to chart a long-term course with a view to utilizing these resources through deeper integration.
Mutual trust and confidence among the Member States are vital to achieving the objectives of SAARC. While we may have difference on certain issues, SAARC process must be insulated and allowed to move forward because we have invested so much time, energy and resources in it. We want to see a SAARC that is both vibrant and united. We must build on our collective strengths and narrow down the differences on the matters of regional cooperation.
Therefore, we must take a bold decision to push the process forward with a strong commitment to deepen cooperation in areas which can really transform the development landscape of this region. Concentration rather than proliferation should be the guiding norms. It is an unpleasant irony that a region, which is rich in both natural and human resources, continues to languish in poverty and hunger at a time when many other regions are making incredible progress in several areas.
This region has huge potentials for development. Apart from development challenges, we continue facing the challenges that cannot be addressed with efforts of an individual member state. The complex and transboundary nature of the challenges make the process regional cooperation indispensable. Therefore, cooperation has no alternative; the cost of non-cooperation will be colossal.
Thank you!

Statement by Hon. Mr. Pradeep Kumar Gyawali, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Nepal, at the 19thAnnual Ministerial Meeting of LLDCs
(23 September 2020)
Mr. Chairman,
Honorable Ministers,
Secretary-General Mr. Antonio Guterres
USG and High Representative for LDCs, LLDCs and SIDS Ms. Utoikamanu
Distinguished Delegates.
Let me extend sincere appreciation to Kazakhstan for providing excellent leadership to the Group.
I thank the UN Secretary-General Mr. Guterres for his solidarity and support.
I also commend the role played by Madam Utoikamanu and her team in promoting the cause of LLDCs.
Mr. Chairman,
At the dawn of the defining decade in achieving SDGs, the COVID-19 has shaken the world.
The disruptions of pandemic have been profound. It has revealed the gaps, compounded the challenges, and multiplied the hardships.
With preventive restrictions on travel and transportation, the fallouts of the crisis on LLDCs have been much severe. As the means to respond to the crisis are limited, our countries are struggling to fend off this double-edged sword of health and economic crisis.
LLDCs face several challenges because of their remoteness and geographical isolation. Distance escalates the cost of development and trade. The dismal productive capacity has further crushed our trade competitiveness.
Excessive commodity dependence has exposed LLDCs to the shocks and fluctuations in international markets. Perennial and large trade deficits have been a sad reality for many LLDCs.
Unhindered, cost-effective and accessible infrastructures coupled with smooth trade-facilitation measures open up the doors of global market.
Investment in infrastructures for LLDCs is an investment in the lifeline of their trade and development.
The potentials unleashed by e-commerce and digital technologies could transform LLDCs by liberating their economies from the rigid clutches of geography. Access to easy, affordable and reliable technology becomes critical for that.
Adverse impacts of climate change such as outburst of glacial lakes, floods, retreat of glaciers, desertification also pose a serious threat to LLDCs. Unfortunately, the current climate finance architecture has no dedicated window for LLDCs.
Mr. Chairman,
The Mid-term review of the VPOA has given us a clear idea on the progress and gaps. We must build on the Call for Action, contained in the political declaration, and intensify our efforts to implement six priority areas of VPOA at all levels –national, regional and global.
An effective partnership between and among LLDCs, their transit neighbors, development partners, UN and other stakeholders will be crucial for this.
Secretary General’s roadmap for accelerating the implementation of VPOA is therefore an important step.
What else could be a better way for a system-wide response as we commemorate the 75th anniversary of the Organization?
In the quest of transforming LLDCs to land-linked with vibrant economies, our response needs to be two-fold.
First, we must put in place a predictable and reliable transit regime and connectivity infrastructures.
And second, we must enhance productive capacities by capitalizing on the new technologies and embracing low-volume high-value products.
For the present, international solidarity should be there in containing the COVID pandemic and addressing the economic fallouts.
In the long run, all means of support, including ODA, trade, technology, and capacity building need to be deployed to support the LLDCs.
Only a genuine spirit of global solidarity to complement the efforts of the LLDCs can ensure that they ride out the current storm and emerge stronger in future.
In Nepal, we have mainstreamed the 2030 Agenda and the VPOA into our national plans and programs. Transforming Nepal to a land-linked country underpins our national aspiration of “Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali”.
To materialize this aspiration, we have focused on building transport infrastructures, enhancing connectivity, and improving investment environment, among others. Our investment in social and human development sector, and reforms in governance have produced positive results.
Let me conclude, Mr. Chairman, by reaffirming Nepal’s commitment to cooperation and solidarity for promoting the Group’s common interests and making the leap to land-linked-ness by leaving no one behind.
I thank you all.

Statement by Prime Minister and the Leader of Nepali Delegation Right Honorable Mr. K P Sharma Oli at the High-level Meeting to Commemorate the 75th Anniversary of the United Nation
(New York, 21 September 2020)
Theme: The future we want, the United Nations we need: Reaffirming our collective commitment to multilateralism
Mr. President,
Mr. Secretary General,
Distinguished delegates.
It is a privilege to be part of this historic occasion marking the 75th anniversary of the UN.
We are convening at an unprecedented time.
The impacts of COVID-19 have hit across lives, economies and societies with toughest brunt felt by the weakest and most vulnerable countries.
Today is an occasion to reaffirm our commitment to peace, prosperity and justice.
We, as humanity, have a responsibility to strengthen the UN and empower it as the centre of multilateralism to deal with the complex challenges the world is confronting.
Nepal’s partnership with the United Nations has been ever-growing in all three pillars.
We have been providing one of the most dedicated and professional services to the UN peace operations for over six decades.
The UN has been a key partner in our development process.
We continue to contribute to the protection and promotion of human rights constructively. We believe that all human rights are equal and must be treated in their totality.
Mr. President,
The United Nations is at ‘generational crossroads’ of continuity and transformation.
It faces a test of delivering on the ever-increasing expectations:
– to protect the neediest countries and peoples,
– to promote the sovereign equality and dignity of all,
– to fight against the threats like pandemics, climate crisis and terrorism, and
– to ensure total elimination of nuclear, chemical, biological, radiological and all other weapons of mass destruction.
Building on the achievements, it is also our collective responsibility to make the world body more ‘fit for purpose’.
Now is the time to do so.
First, there is no alternative to unity, solidarity and cooperation. We must reaffirm these values and commit ourselves to move beyond rhetoric to action.
Second, it is important that the UN is focused on the twelve ‘action points’ highlighted in the Declaration we adopted today and mobilize support for the entirety of the SDGs so that no one is left behind.
Third, with timely reforms, we must enable UN to build a just, fair, and rules-based international order where no nation is superior than others.
Finally, we need to strengthen the UN and ensure that it is stronger and better prepared to tackle the existential threats and emergencies.
To conclude, Mr. President, let us solemnly commit ourselves at this historic 75th anniversary to build a more prosperous and happy global community in an atmosphere of comprehensive democracy. Let us make the UN fit for this purpose.
Thank you!

Statement by Rt. Hon. Prime Minister Mr. K P Sharma Oli at the SDG Moment
Friday, 18 September 2020
Excellencies the Heads of State and Government,
UN Secretary General Mr. Antonio Guterres,
Distinguished Delegates:
At the outset, I would like to commend the Secretary General for convening this high-level event.
We are meeting at a critical juncture. The COVID-19 pandemic has devastated livelihoods, disrupted economies, and distressed the public health and social security systems.
Most importantly, as we embark on the decade of action and delivery of the 2030 Agenda, the pandemic has derailed the momentum of its implementation. The challenges have compounded, and gaps have widened.
However, this is not a moment to shift the goalposts further. Nor is it a time to back off in despair.
To navigate these turbulent times, the SDGs must serve as the compass of clarity.
Excellencies,
Sustainable development is at the center of Nepal’s development vision and priorities. It underpins our national aspiration of “Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali”.
We have mainstreamed the SDGs into the national plans and programs. They are now being localized.
Showcasing our progress in SDGs, we presented our second Voluntary National Review Report in High-level Political Forum in July this year.
We have made some significant achievements in key areas –including poverty reduction, food security, education, gender equality, basic sanitation, and energy access. Our people have been enjoying fundamental rights and freedoms as enshrined in the Constitution.
However, the challenges and gaps remain. The current health crisis threatens our hard-earned gains, pushing our plan to graduate from the LDC status in peril.
This COVID-19 pandemic has affected the countries in special situation such as LDCs, LLDCs and SIDs disproportionately.
Their freezing economy, shrinking revenue, increasing public expenditure, rising poverty and unemployment have severe impact in the attainment of the SDGs.
We welcome the global initiatives and support measures taken in response to COVID-19.
But this is not enough.
Aligning these support measures with the 2030 Agenda, Istanbul Program of Action, Vienna Program of Action, Addis Agenda and the Paris Agreement is equally important.
For this, there is an urgent need to accelerate action at all levels and by all stakeholders beyond rhetoric.
Our message should be of a cautious hope to steer the decade of action as well as recovery with sustainability at its core.
In conclusion, a renewed sense of urgency and accountability in our collective efforts is critical to build back better, and to ensure that no one is left behind.

Statement by Minister for Foreign Affairs Hon. Mr. Pradeep Kumar Gyawali at the Annual Ministerial Meeting of LDCs
17 September 2020
9:00- 13:00hrs
Mr. Chairman,
Honorable Ministers,
USG and High Representative for LDCs, LLDCs and SIDS Ms. Utoikamanu
Distinguished Delegates.
I would like to thank Malawi for organizing this meeting and for steering the activities of the Group during these challenging times.
I also appreciate the role of the USG and High Representative and her team for the diligent work to support the LDCs.
Mr. Chairman,
The COVID-19 pandemic has made ravaging impact on LDCs. Loss of exports, decline of investment, remittances and tourism coupled with commodity price shocks are causing far-reaching socio-economic consequences.
Given the sweeping impacts of the pandemic all over the world, LDCs risk losing the ODA flow.
The pandemic has also amplified the inherent vulnerabilities of the LDCs. These countries are struggling to devise effective response, due to the limitations in – resource base, social protection and health systems.
We acknowledge the support and swift action taken by the United Nations, G20 countries, the IMF, World Bank, WHO and other multilateral and bilateral development partners in response to COVID-19.
But this is not sufficient.
We need to devise other enabling conditions as well, where ODA shortfalls are compensated by lifting of trade barriers, debt relief, transfer of technology and knowledge, and scaling up aid for trade.
Technology transfer to the LDCs is critical to build a foundation for more equal and prosperous world.
Emergency global health package for LDCs including the quick, affordable, and universal access to anti-COVID vaccine, once it is developed, is equally important.
This is a time that we promote international cooperation and solidarity and strengthen multilateral institutions like the United Nations to address the challenges the world is facing.
As we celebrate the 75th anniversary of the United Nations, this is also a fitting moment to ensure that LDCs challenges and concerns find due space and priority in all multilateral processes, including the United Nations.
Mr. Chairman,
A landlocked and least developed country, Nepal has its own share of the brunt of the pandemic.
It has wrought our economy to a standstill –impacting industry, employment, trade, revenues, tourism, and remittances. It is likely to constrain Nepal’s economic growth to less than 2.3% during this fiscal year.
Vulnerabilities to climate change and natural disasters further accentuate our development challenges.
Our hard-earned development gains are under threat, and the pandemic risks our plan for a smooth and sustainable graduation from the LDC status.
However, our aspiration for graduation has not weakened.
Mr. Chairman,
We are in the final stage of the implementation of Istanbul Programme of Action. Our focus must be on its unfinished business.
It is also a time to reflect upon the gap between the action-plan and its implementation and identify the bottlenecks that need our introspection.
We acknowledge various international support measures and initiatives taken so far to support the LDCs and implement the IPOA. 
Our efforts must be towards creating jobs and advancing inclusive growth. This will not be possible without an enhanced level of external finance, including the FDI. Every country must be enabled to gain from the trade.
In this context, we reiterate the call for a global stimulus package for the LDCs to be funded and implemented with immediate effect.
To conclude, Mr. Chairman, LDCs deserve special attention of the international community in their efforts to achieve peace, development and prosperity. Reaching furthest behind first demands our concerted and collective effort because the decade of action and delivery of SDGs will not be realized if LDCs are left behind.
I thank you.

Posted onJuly 8, 2020 

Virtual Address by Rt. Honourable Mr.  K P Sharma Oli, Prime Minister of Nepal, to ILO Global Summit on COVID-19 and the World of Work – Building a Better Future of Work
Geneva, 8 July 2020
Mr. President,
Excellencies the Heads of State and Government,
Director General of ILO Mr. Guy Ryder,
Employers’ and Workers’ Representatives,
Ladies and Gentlemen 
Let me commend the Director General of ILO for taking this timely initiative.
The world is now seized by an invisible enemy, the pandemic of COVID-19.
Over five hundred thousand people have lost their lives. It is uncertain how it will unfold further. Invention of vaccine and making it judiciously accessible to all remains unclear.
In such a situation, protecting the lives of people becomes extremely important. Loss of human life cannot be replenished.
The pandemic has thrown millions of workers and enterprises vulnerable.  Overall economy has suffered with global decline in investment, trade and disruption in travel industry. As a consequence, people are losing jobs.
Economists project a bleak scenario for global growth in 2020.
When labour-intensive job-market declines, millions will fall into poverty. The impact becomes unevenly high in the LDCs and low-income countries. Declining remittances and potential reduction in ODA and shrinking of other resources will further compound economic stagnation.
Crisis of this proportion calls for robust global response with United Nations and its specialized agencies like ILO at the centre.
We should support and strengthen them to promote human-centred agenda of decent work as embraced by the ILO.
Protection of the most vulnerable, including the migrant workers and those in informal sectors, and provision of adequate social security and health care is key to minimize the impact.
However, it is unfortunate that migrant workers who have contributed to the building of destination countries are losing hopes and returning home in the midst of the pandemic without protection of their job and income.
This situation, contrary to the ILO principles, could have been avoided and norms of WHO should have been observed in the process. In Nepal, within 108 days, in an average 3000 people returned home every day from India crossing our land border. About half a million migrant workers are expected to return from the Gulf region and other countries. It does not mean that we are not welcoming our nationals back home. But this scale of sudden return has posed tremendous pressure on our health system as the cases of infection shoot up rapidly.
I held several telephone conversations with Heads of State and Government in  labour destination countries seeking their cooperation for the protection and wellbeing of the Nepali workers. At home, we are protecting foreign nationals in our country during this pandemic.
Humanity is tested in the time of crisis. Our conscience should guide us to uphold justice and fairness even in the time of extreme difficulty. International solidarity at this hour could prevent the job loss, return of migrant workers and reversal in the progress of SDG and resulting rise of poverty.
Poverty and sudden stress on local labour market endangers larger peace and stability worldwide.
Excellencies,
We in Nepal have invested resources within our capacity to fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.
We have employed both preventive and mitigating measures that include testing, contact-tracing, quarantine, isolation and social distancing. We are close to meeting the target of testing two per cent of our population.
Temporary measures, such as, nation-wide lockdown and restriction in movement helped us to contain the virus to a large extent. Number of deaths so far remains minimal.
Estimates are that nearly 63 percent of Nepali workforce will face some degree of impacts, which is more severe in urban areas and in service industries like hotel restaurant catering and tourism sector.
We have responded to the situation with some immediate and medium-term measures.
For those in informal sector, we have provided food and wage for work as an immediate relief.
For those in the formal sector, we have ensured payroll protection, re-scheduling and capitalization of loans and waivers on electricity, among others. We are trying to convert this challenge into opportunity with special focus on building our health infrastructures.
In the medium term, we have devised programs such as, Prime Minister’s Employment Program, food for work, subsidy to private sector for internship wages, skilling for re-deployment, and reorienting of poverty alleviation funds for production and sustainable employment generation, restructuring of agriculture and support to SMEs.
Provincial and local governments are also implementing programs for promoting job opportunities in coordination and collaboration with the federal Government.
While we are committed to partnership and social dialogue in the process, we also look forward to greater solidarity to address the situation globally.
I thank you.

Statement by Prime Minister of Nepal Rt. Hon. Mr. K P Sharma Oli at the Online Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) Contact Group
Posted onMay 4, 2020May 4, 2020 


 
Statement by Prime Minister of Nepal Rt. Hon. Mr. K P Sharma Oli at the Online Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) Contact Group
Kathmandu, 4 May 2020
Theme: “United against COVID-19”
Your Excellency Mr. Ilham Aliyev, President of the Republic of Azerbaijan, and the Chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement,
Your Excellencies the Heads of State and Government,
Distinguished Participants.
At the outset, I would like to thank Your Excellency President Ilham Aliyev for this timely initiative to bring us together.
Nepal welcomes your initiative to establish the NAM Contact Group for our collective fight against the COVID-19.
The Pandemic has shaken the world in a magnitude not experienced in our lifetime; yet it has reminded us how deeply our fate is interwoven in this global village.
The humanity is at stake now.
Close to two hundred and fifty thousand lives are lost. Our health facilities have been overwhelmed. The virus has tested our ability and exposed our vulnerability.
Global trading and travel linkages are disrupted. Businesses have collapsed.
Jobs are vanished.
Education systems are disrupted, and
Millions risk relapsing into poverty making the realization of SDGs even harder.
We are now fighting a common but invisible enemy.
In such a situation, I believe that there is nothing more important than the protection of human life and saving of humanity. This is the supreme duty of Governments.
We can revive economic loss. We can reinvent technology. We can build a prosperous society. But, we cannot revive the loss of precious human life, which is also the loss of human capital, talents, expertise and ideas. So, life comes first of all other considerations.
Humanity must prevail, not the virus. For this, health must be our topmost priority.
Mindful of this, in Nepal, we have deployed all political, economic, human and technological resources at our disposal to contain the spread of the virus.
Our focus has been on both the prevention and mitigation of the pandemic. We have marshalled all resources and state machinery at federal, provincial and local level to manage and respond to the crisis in a coherent way.
We have upgraded health facilities, incentivized health care workers, and ensured accessible health services for all. We have installed additional facilities for quarantine and isolation.
We have pursued combination of measures, such as, testing, contact-tracing, quarantine and social distancing. At the same time, we have enforced temporary measures, such as, nation-wide lockdown, suspension of international flights and restriction in cross-border movement of the people.
I am happy to share that, as of today, there is no death from Covid-19 in Nepal.
I must underline though the unprecedented economic hardship that we are facing. The whole economy is in standstill. Understandably, small enterprises, peasants and daily wage earners are the hardest hit. Remittances and revenue sources have declined. Tourism has shattered. The pace of development will suffer, so will the sources of livelihood of the people.
While we are determined to face the challenge, we believe that crisis of this proportion calls for robust global response. National endeavors must be complemented by international support measures.
Here comes the indispensable role of the United Nations and its specialized agency, WHO. They must be strengthened and supported to promote cooperation, collaboration and synchronize global response against the pandemic.
Non-Aligned Movement, as a group of 120 countries, must use its numerical and moral strength to unite the world at this critical moment of human history.
If the world unites, we will win the war. If the world divides, virus will defeat us. And there is no other choice, but the virus must be defeated.

In this context, I would like to highlight the following points:
First and foremost, NAM must remain united at this critical hour and support multilateralism and global cooperation to defeat COVID-19 and to help achieve the shared aspiration of peace, stability and prosperity.
Second, NAM must coordinate actions to help its Member States and consolidate the voice of the poorest and most vulnerable population around the world in the spirit of global solidarity.
In this regard, Nepal welcomes the proposal to establish the NAM Task Force to work out a database that will include requirements of NAM Member States.
Third, NAM must do its part to ensure that the world bounces back to normal. While galvanizing global unity, we need to scale up South-South Cooperation by way of sharing experience, transfer of technology, medical logistics and equipment.
Fourth, NAM must coordinate and advocate for launching of a robust recovery package from the international community to address the looming economic recession. The impacts are already massive worldwide and they are disproportionate to the LDCs, LLDCs and SIDs in particular. The crisis should not provide an excuse to retreat from existing commitments to the developing countries.
Fifth, NAM must promote regional initiatives as building blocks for global efforts. In South Asian region, leaders of SAARC countries came together for a summit level video conference to promote cooperation and find solution to the challenges posed by COVID-19.
Sixth, humanity must come together to fight against the challenges of poverty, illness and under-development. This is not a time to engage in insurgencies and wars. Therefore, Nepal supports UN Secretary General’s Appeal for Global Ceasefire.
Finally, the pandemic has exposed the inadequacies and fragility in existing economic system. We must ensure that states reorient economic arrangements and redeploy resources for building and maintaining of basic social protection, health care and education. Pro-people policies stand better to deal with the crisis like this.
Before I conclude, Mr. Chairman, let me express my profound condolences to the countries and families for the loss of lives and wish for speedy recovery of those undergoing treatment.
Together we will rebound; and rebound better.
I thank you for your attention.

Statement by Hon. Mr. Pradeep Kumar Gyawali, Minister for Foreign Affairs at the High-Level Segment of the 43rd Session of Human Rights Council, Geneva
Posted onFebruary 25, 2020 


Statement by Honourable Mr. Pradeep Kumar Gyawali, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Head of the Nepali delegation at the High-Level Segment of the 43rd Session of Human Rights Council
Geneva, Tuesday, 25 February 2020, 16:00 hrs.
Madam President
Madam High Commissioner
Excellencies,
I feel honoured to be back to the Council again.
This session is taking place at the beginning of the new decade marked by optimism, empowerment and equality.
With the 25th anniversary of the Beijing Declaration, the 75th anniversary of the United Nations, and a full circle of a hundred years of multilateralism, we have come a long way towards realizing the common aspiration of ‘leaving no one behind’ by ensuring opportunity, justice and human rights for all.
These landmark events remind us of our determination to maintaining world peace, protecting human rights and fundamental freedom, and embracing socio-economic progress.
Nepal remains steadfast in those commitments, principles and values.
Nepal firmly believes in the universality, in-divisibility, inter-relatedness, inter-dependence and mutually reinforcing nature of human rights, including the right to development. We believe that the rule of law and human rights must be evenly operational at national, regional and international levels.
We are a party to all major international human rights instruments including seven of the nine core such instruments. We have internalized those values and standards into our national laws, policies and practices.
The Constitution of Nepal is founded on universally recognized human rights and such other principles as inclusive multiparty democratic polity, pluralism, the rule of law, and representative and accountable government. Independence of judiciary and full freedom of press are the salient tenets of Nepal’s Constitution.
Social justice is integral to our democratic process. The Constitution guarantees special measures for weaker sections of our society to enable them enjoy fundamental rights and receive a fair share of representation in all spheres of national life.
Nepal, as a secular State, guarantees freedom of religion as a fundamental right. The religious tolerance in Nepali society is exemplary.
We recognize the role of the grassroots community organizations, civil society, human rights defenders, and the media as the indispensable partners in the promotion and protection of human rights.
The National Human Rights Commission of Nepal conforms to the Paris Principles and stands accredited as ‘A’ category national human rights institution.
As one of the pioneer countries to implement National Human Rights Action Plan since 2004, we are now preparing the 5th National Action Plan.
Madam President,
Having achieved democratic political order and stability in the country, Nepal is now focused to realize the vision of “Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali”. We have mainstreamed Sustainable Development Goals into the national development plan with a view to realize them by 2030.
We practice equality and non-discrimination and remain committed to ensuring full enjoyment of all human rights by women and girls. The progress made by Nepal in terms of gender equality and empowerment provides a reason to be proud.
Marking the 30th anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child last year, we have pledged to ending all forms of child labour, ending Child Marriage and enacted the Right to Safe Motherhood and Reproductive Health Act.
We are fully committed to the rights of persons with disabilities. The measures of positive discrimination that we have implemented to enable them participate in political and public life have produced good impacts. Provisioning of adequate resources and infrastructure for quality and inclusive education for children with disabilities remains our continued priority.
Madam President,
Migration has been one of the defining phenomena of our time.
Being one of the major countries of origin; safety, security, dignity and welfare of the migrant workers is a matter of paramount importance for us.
Protection of rights of migrant workers, including women migrant workers, and combating trafficking in person requires cooperative efforts at national, regional and international levels. We believe that the historic commitment expressed through Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration (GCM) provides a framework of cooperation to ensuring migration benefits for all.
A clean, healthy and sustainable environment is essential for the full enjoyment of all human rights.
As a mountainous country, impact of global warming is of particular concern for us. While we support Council’s attention to human rights vis a vis climate change, Nepal has initiated a multi-stakeholder global dialogue forum- Sagarmatha Sambaad- named after the world’s tallest mountain, known as the Mt. Everest, to deliberate on the issues of common interest.
The first edition of this dialogue will be convened in Kathmandu from 2 to 4 April this year on the theme of ‘Climate Change, Mountains and the Future of the Humanity’.
Madam President
Nepal presents a uniquely successful case of nationally led and owned conflict transformation and peace process.  We are dealing with the incidences of conflict era human rights violations through two independent Commissions – the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission for Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons. The term of the Commissions has been extended to ensure the completion of their work. The newly appointed Commissioners have started functioning in full swing.
We stand firmly to our commitment to addressing remaining issues of transitional justice in accordance with the Comprehensive Peace Accord, directive of the Supreme Court, relevant international commitments, concerns of the victims, and the ground realities.
Nepal appreciates the continuous goodwill and understanding of the international community.
Madam President
The Human Rights Council and its mechanisms have been playing important role in promoting universal respect for all human rights.
The UPR has successfully evolved as a transparent and fair process of promoting dialogue and cooperation and a meaningful exercise for the improvement of human rights situation everywhere.
In Nepal, we have been implementing the outcome of the second cycle of UPR in earnest under an updated plan of actions. Nepal looks forward to the Third Cycle of Review in November this year.
Nepal attaches great importance to the work of Special Procedures mandate-holders. We continue to be constructively engaged with them. We welcome country visits by Special Procedures at a mutually convenient time. We regularly respond to the Communications of the Special Procedures and treaty bodies.
We are committed to our obligation to submit periodic reports on regular basis. In 2018 alone, Nepal’s periodic reports under CRPD, CERD and CEDAW were considered. Preparation of latest reports under CAT, ICCPR, ICESCR and CRC are underway.
Our experience as a member of the Council has inspired us to consolidate democracy, advance socio-economic transformation, and promote universal respect for and observance of human rights. We have made utmost efforts to fulfil our pledges and commitments.
In this spirit, Nepal has submitted candidature for the membership of the Human Rights Council for the second term 2021 to 2023. We count on the valuable support of all UN Member States.
We have strong faith in the values of multilateralism to strengthen and sustain our common aspiration of a peaceful, prosperous and just world. We remain committed to working together in a balanced and objective manner for the universal protection and promotion of human rights.
I thank you.

Remarks by Honorable Mr. Pradeep Kumar Gyawali, Minister for Foreign Affairs,at the 72nd Anniversary Program of Nepal Council of World Affairs
(16:30 hrs, 16 February 2020, Kathmandu)
 
Chief Guest of the Program Vice President Right Honorable Mr. Nanda Bahadur Pun,
President of Nepal Council of World Affairs,
Excellencies and Members from Diplomatic Community,
Representatives from United Nations, Academia, Private Sector and Civil Society,
Friends from the media,
Ladies and Gentlemen!
Namaskar and Good Afternoon to you all.
It is a pleasure and honour to be present in this commemoration of the 72nd anniversary of Nepal Council of World Affairs (NCWA).
While thanking the NCWA for inviting me at this important event, let me begin by congratulating its office bearers and members on this special occasion.
NCWA deserves our appreciation for hosting this annual event almost regularly with fruitful and creative deliberations on pertinent topics of foreign policy and international relations.
Today, I have been asked by the host to speak a few words on Nepal’s foreign relations and the relations with neighboring countries. The topic demands to touch all aspects of Nepal’s external relations, including with the neighbors. I will be brief and try to do justice to this rather comprehensive topic.
Distinguished friends,
The world today is highly connected, complex and inter-dependent. Survival, security and prosperity have been basic elements that every nation state endeavors to maximize. At the same time, creating an international order that is conducive for all to exist, prosper and thrive is important for peace and security. This demands cooperation among nations and their willingness to act collectively to respond to the challenges of global scale. As a dignified member in the comity of nations, Nepal’s efforts have been around this basic character of modern nation states. Safeguarding Nepal’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity; protecting national interest and the interests of its people; and ensuring Nepal’s security and economic wellbeing have been all along the fundamental tenets of Nepal’s international relations.
The Constitution of Nepal has guided basic framework for the conduct of Nepal’s foreign relations. The Constitution also defines core elements of our national interest. Safeguarding of the freedom, sovereignty, territorial integrity, nationalism, independence and dignity of the country, border security, economic wellbeing and prosperity and the rights of the Nepali people are defined as the elements of Nepal’s national interest. Service to the national interests is therefore the primary objective of our foreign policy goal.
The Constitution also directs Nepal to pursue independent foreign policy and adhere to the principles of the UN Charter, non-alignment, Panchsheel, international law and the norms of world peace while conducting foreign relations. In doing so, sovereign equality and dignity of the nation are two critical elements that Nepal attaches great importance.
These guiding principles and our time-tested practice of external relations have enabled us to take independent posture on international issues, articulate our views on merit basis, contribute to the world peace, and nurture friendship with all countries of the world.
Nepal practices ‘amity with all, enmity with none’ and considers international relations should be based on justice, sovereign equality, mutual respect and shared benefit. We want to promote Nepal’s credentials as an open, progressive, and democratic State.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Nepal maintains friendly and cooperative relations with both of her immediate neighbours: India and China. Maintaining close and cordial relationship with them is our priority. Our relations have expanded manifold in the sphere of political, economic, cultural, trade, tourism, investment, and people-to-people exchanges. Nepal’s neighbourhood provides opportunities for expanding economic linkages. Regular exchange of high level visits and increasing people to people contacts have further strengthened these relations and deepened the spirit of cooperation. Nepal is conscious of the legitimate interests of our neighbours and will not allow any activity against them in our soil and expect the same understanding from our neighbours.
Nepal and India enjoy historically close and multi-faceted relations. These relations are nurtured by extensive people to people level contacts and socio-cultural bonds that we share for centuries. The exchange of visits by the Prime Ministers of Nepal and India in April and May 2018 has contributed to further enhance mutual trust and consolidate bilateral relations. Our two countries are committed to take forward cooperation and partnership on the basis of equality, mutual trust, respect and mutual benefit. We have agreed to advance cooperation in the core areas of agriculture, railway linkages and inland waterways.
The high level visits in 2018 provided major push for the implementation of ongoing development projects. Some of the flagship projects, such as, Motihari to Amlekhgunj Petroleum Pipeline and Integrated Check Posts in Birgunj and Biratnagar have been completed. Similarly, reconstruction of over 45,000 housing units in Nuwakot and Gorkha districts under the assistance of India have been completed and they were handed over to the residents last month. Construction of remaining housing units is undergoing. Construction of Jay Nagar-Kurtha section of the rail project has been completed. This will ultimately link Bardibas with Jaynagar upon completion of another 34 Km section of the rail line. Detailed project report of Birgunj-Kathmandu electric railway is being prepared this year. Arun III hydro-electricity project under Indian investment is progressing well after the foundation stone of the project was jointly laid by the two Prime Ministers. More projects enhancing production, trade and connectivity are in focus for the future.
You are aware that the Government of Nepal is in communication with the Government of India for a dialogue and settlement of the border issue of Kalapani through diplomatic means. We anticipate mutually convenient dates for the meeting would be worked out soon on this issue. The leaders on both sides have displayed clear vision, commitment and required political will to take the relationship to a higher plane of trust, cooperation and friendship. Prime Minister K P Oli’s vision of ‘prosperous Nepal, happy Nepali’ is unleashing, among others, Nepal’s connectivity potentials with both of our neighbors and building necessary infrastructures for that purpose and goes well with India’s policy of ‘neighborhood first’ and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of ‘sab ka saath sab ka bikash’.
Nepal and China enjoy a long history of close and cordial relationship, which is based on the five principles of peaceful co-existence. Appreciation of each other’s aspirations as well as respect for each other’s concerns and sensitivities has injected an important element of trust in our relationship. Nepal remains fully committed to one China policy. We admire China’s neighbourhood diplomacy guided by the principles of sincerity, amity, mutual benefit and inclusiveness.
During the official visit to China by the Right Honourable Prime Minister of Nepal we agreed to intensify implementation of MoU on cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative to enhance connectivity. The cooperation covers building of dry ports, roads, railways, aviation and communications network within the framework of Trans-Himalaya Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network.
We have concluded some important agreements with China in recent years for enhancing multidimensional connectivity between the two countries. The Protocol on implementing Transit Transport Agreement has already been signed that provides Nepal access to the Chinese seaports and dry ports and facilitates the operationalization of the transit transport agreement. This is an important milestone towards Nepal’s transformation from a landlocked country to a land-linked country. Another MoU for building cross-border transmission line with China concluded last year is also equally important in terms of promoting multi-dimensional connectivity. Trans-Himalayan Railway will be a game changer. Our two countries have already signed MoU on Cooperation in the Railway Project. Pre-feasibility study of this project has already been completed and now we are in the process of feasibility study and preparation of detailed project report.
The visit to Nepal by Chinese President Xi Jinping in October last year was a significant milestone in the annals of relations between the two countries. Total twenty agreements were signed during the visit which includes cooperation to enhance road, railway and tunnel connectivity along with increasing Chinese investment in Nepal. The visit provided a momentum for the speedy implementation of the agreements reached in the past and to carry on the decision taken during the visit of the Chinese President.
We consider the growing economic development and strength of our neighbours as an opportunity for us to move ahead with economic development. We admire our neighbours for their continued goodwill and support to our national aspirations and for their cooperation in the development efforts of Nepal.
Nepal’s relations with the countries in the extended neighbourhood are based on mutual respect, goodwill and understanding which we wish to sustain and consolidate. They are further nurtured by growing cultural and traditional ties. Our priority is to further explore, open up and diversify our relations especially in the areas of trade, investment, tourism and people-to-people exchanges.
Nepal has always maintained cordial and cooperative relations with major powers and development partners. Their goodwill and support to Nepal in her development endeavour has been an enduring aspect of our friendship. We value this cooperation and remain grateful to our development partners for their continued support. We look forward to a greater partnership to promote investment and technology transfer for our economic development and implementation of sustainable development goals. We continue to work towards enriching the substance of cooperation in our bilateral engagements with these countries.
Labour migration has become an important aspect of Nepal’s foreign relations. A large number of Nepali nationals are engaged in foreign employment and the remittances they send home make a sizable share of our economy. Therefore, it becomes Government’s priority to work closely with the countries of destination for safety, security and wellbeing of our migrant workers. In recent years our engagements with the labour destination countries have been more intensive and enriched by exchange of high level visits, and progressively growing trade and investment. We look forward to expand and diversify the scope of cooperation with these countries so as to encompass the broader areas of economic partnership involving trade, investment, tourism and civil aviation, among others.
Dear Friends,
Nepal continues to engage at regional and sub-regional level for promotion of economic cooperation and connectivity. As the Chair of SAARC, Nepal has done its best for the revival of the stalled SAARC process. We have been actively working at BIMSTEC to promote economic cooperation, connectivity and prosperity. Nepal plays its due role in Asian Cooperation Dialogue (ACD) as its member and in Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) as a dialogue partner.
In the multilateral arena, Nepal supports multilateralism to promote a just and equitable international order in which all States – big or small – fulfill their international obligations in good faith, and enjoy equal opportunity to achieve their aspirations for development and prosperity. We consider that stability and predictability in the global order is essential for maintaining international peace and security. Nepal believes in rule-based and just multilateral system with the United Nations (UN) at its centre. We have abiding faith on the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.
As an active member of the UN, Nepal has contributed significantly for over six decades to the maintenance of international peace and security and protection of human rights. Nepal currently stands 5th largest troop and police contributing country in the UN peace operations.
Nepal attaches high importance to the protection and promotion of human rights. Human rights hold the centre stage in our Constitution. We are a State party to twenty-four international human rights-related instruments, including seven out of nine core Conventions. Nepal considers all human rights are universal, in-divisible, inter-dependent, inter-related and mutually reinforcing.
As a member of UN Human Rights Council Nepal has played objective and impartial role in the Council. To further contribute to the work of the Council in an impartial manner and share our achievements in human rights, Nepal has presented candidature for re-election to the Council for the term 2021-23.
Nepal continues to champion the cause of LDCs, LLDCs, South-South and triangular cooperation in the UN and other international forums.  Solidarity and cooperation with LDCs, LLDCs and SIDS will continue to characterize our deliberations.
Nepal accords high priority to the issue of climate change. Nepal supports effective implementation of the Paris Agreement and calls for enhanced level of climate finance and technology transfer for the adaptation and mitigation.
As a responsible member in the comity of nations, we intend to contribute to the larger policy discourse on issues of common importance. To this end, Nepal has decided to establish a multi-stakeholder permanent dialogue forum in Kathmandu – ‘Sagarmatha Sambaad’- to deliberate on prominent issues of global, regional and national significance. The first episode of the Sambaad will be held in the first week of April 2020 in Kathmandu under the theme of ‘Climate Change, Mountains and the Future of the Humanity’.
To conclude, let me stress that the ultimate purpose of a country’s foreign policy is to serve its vital national interests and support realization of national aspiration. Nepal’s foreign policy has served her national interest well in the context of changing global and regional dynamics. We remain conscious that fundamentals of our foreign policy comply with the constitutional provisions and our practice remains consistent, coherent and credible.
I thank you all for your attention.

Vice Chancellor of Lumbini Buddhist University,
Venerable Vice Chair of Lumbini Development Trust, Excellencies,
Eminent scholars from home and abroad,
Distinguished delegates, panelists and participants,
Friends from the media,
Ladies and Gentlemen.
Namaskar and Good Morning to you all.
At the outset, I would like to thank the organizers, Lumbini Research Centre for Peace and Understanding, in collaboration with Lumbini Buddhist University, Lumbini Development Trust and Nepal Council for World Affairs,  for inviting me to this important gathering of eminent scholars discussing international understanding and peace.
I welcome the distinguished international delegates to Nepal and wish for their comfortable stay.
I particularly appreciate the organizers for choosing Lumbini as the venue of this conference. There cannot be a better choice. It is an honour and privilege to speak on peace from the birthplace of Lord Buddha, the apostle of peace.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Quest for peace and understanding has been a long and cherished goal of humanity all along the history. Civilizations have evolved, thrived and prospered due largely to the prevalence of peace. They have died due to lack of it.
We are talking about peace in the world, peace among the States, peace among the communities, peace among the religions and cultures, peace among civilizations and peace of mind within an individual. They all are inter-related and mutually reinforcing.
We have seen unprecedented prosperity and progress achieved in a state of peace at all levels.
At the same time, major catastrophes have occurred in the course of history in absence of peace and temptation to war.
We have seen devastating world wars. We have seen making and unmaking of nation States. We have seen long and perennial animosity between and among civilizations and death of civilizations. We have seen crusades between religions to prevail one over the other. We have seen massacre and genocides between and among communities. We have witnessed ethnic cleansing and mass exodus of people due to their colour, faith, ethnicity or origin.
As if this is not enough, we have seen race for armament of nuclear, biological or chemical weapons. It is an irony that competition for weapons of mass destruction basically emanates from the rich and prosperous parts of the world and now extends to lesser prosperous regions as well.
Though it is pretended for ensuring effective deterrence for their security, in reality race of nuclear arms never ensures security, rather creates a state of suicidal security dilemma.
Let me quote the teachings of Buddha from Dhammapada that seems pretty relevant to this state of affairs.
I quote
“The kind of seed sown will produce that kind of fruit.
Those who do good will reap good results.
Those who do evil will reap evil results.
If you carefully plant a good seed, you will joyfully gather good fruit.”
Unquote.
Race for weapons of mass destruction exactly resembles this irony. It is not a good seed to be sown. Nor will it produce good fruits to enjoy.
Gautam Buddha spread the message of peace across the world. His was the message for reason, harmony, co-existence, love and compassion. It was an inclusive message of peace for all without any distinction on the basis of nationality, race, color or any other denomination. It was a message for equality, justice and truth which constitute the fundamental basis for peace.
Regrettably, whenever Buddha’s message has been crossed or ignored, there have been wars and devastation, human suffering and destruction.
Dialogue and engagements are the tools to promote peace. Dialogues have potentials to prevent wars as well as to conclude war and restore peace.
Dear Friends,
A more systematic global attempt for the establishment of peace and promotion of cooperation among the nation States began in the ashes of the First World War.
However, due to lack of dialogue and understanding, peace could not prevail for long. The world was pushed into another devastation of Second World War.
Then we created an edifice of United Nations to ensure peace and collective security through cooperation and collaboration among Member States.
This edifice has been largely successful to avert a world-scale war. However, many parts of the world unfortunately have been engulfed in internal conflicts, inter-state conflicts, communal strife, and low intensity wars. Scales of damage wrecked by these conflicts compound in millions of lives, trillions of dollars of properties damaged and immense suffering of human being, including innocent children, women and elderly.
None of these conflicts have brought stability and peace by themselves. It is ultimately the dialogues, negotiation, engagements and collaboration that have transformed conflicts into peace.
Our own experience of 10 years of armed conflict followed by successfully negotiated peace process speaks volumes of the importance of dialogue and understanding in promoting peace. Our peace process is a testimony of how requisite political will and accommodation, negotiation and dialogue can resolve conflicts.
Having achieved political stability, we are now focused on socio-economic transformation with the overarching aspiration of “Prosperous Nepal Happy Nepali”.
Harmony and co-existence make essential ingredients of our culture. We believe in “Vawatu Sarba Mangalam (May all be blessed with auspicious) and “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam” (The world is a family). Unity in diversity is our basic mantra of cohesive society.
At the international level, Nepal believes in friendship and harmony in the world. Nepal has always stood for total elimination of all weapons of mass destruction. We support peaceful resolution of international and inter-state disputes. We have stood for fairness, justice and peace in international affairs. We have passionately espoused the cause of the LDCs, LLDCs and the countries in special situation and called for greater international solidarity for their development. We have consistently promoted the agenda of climate justice as well as implementation of the Agenda 2030 for sustainable development.
For over 62 years, Nepal has been rendering extraordinary contribution to international peace and security through our participation in UN peace operations. Currently Nepal stands as the 5th largest troop and police contributing country to the UN Peace operations. Our troops and police have successfully protected civilians from violence, helped respond to humanitarian crises, create an environment conducive to peaceful settlement, helped maintain truce, implement peace agreements, clear landmines and assist in laying foundation for durable peace.
We are a member of the UN Peace Building Commission and active member of the Group of Friends of Mediation that promotes the peaceful means of dispute settlement.
Our voice of reason and conscience resonates in other important UN entities and international forums as well. In the Human Rights Council we speak for the voiceless in an objective and impartial manner. In ILO we promote social justice and dialogue.
Overall, we support multilateralism, rule-based international order, and international cooperation and collaboration to address global issues of common concern.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Pursuit of peace has always been humanity’s highest aspiration. Sometimes, peace is understood as the opposite of conflict, violence or war. Certainly war historically has been the fundamental antithesis of peace. But a sound state of peace is more than that.
Albert Einstein says,
“Peace is not merely the absence of war but the presence of justice, of law, of order- in short, of government”.
Absence of conflict or war merely provides a condition for the beginning of peace. True peace includes personal wholeness, righteousness, political justice, human dignity and equal opportunity for development in all dimensions- individual, cultural, social, ecological and political.
They all collectively and individually contribute for political peace in a larger organized society. Sense of partnership, collaboration, participation, respect for voice and dissent and legitimacy are the source of political peace. Few exceptional individuals like Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King Junior and Nelson Mandela followed non-violence as a means of attaining the goal of political peace.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Development is the prerequisite for peace. Deprivation, lack of basic human needs and underdevelopment fuel dissatisfaction in the society, which eventually invites the conflict. So human centric development is the foundation for sustainable peace. The adoption of the Agenda 2030 was a display of the commitment for inclusive development at its best. The Agenda can be implemented if similar spirit holds at the core of our actions with renewed sense of partnership and each side shouldering the responsibility, to attain the most desired peace in the world.
Achieving the sustainable development goals hinges on resources.
Desire for peace is human nature. However, peace needs continuous nurturing. Conflicts, discords, armaments, animosity breeds wars. Wars become devastating when they are aided and assisted by advanced automated technology. The world has produced enough ammunition, nuclear or otherwise, to destroy the world several times. Display of arms against arms is not a solution to the problem. Neither arms can foster peace. What is the need of the hour is dialogue and understanding. Dialogues enable and nurture greater understanding between and among individuals, communities, leaders, nation States, civilizations and religions. Understanding facilitates dialogues and helps to establish and sustain peace.
All stakeholders have a role to play in promoting peace and understanding between and among nations. Governments, civil society, religious institutions and scholars, academicians, think tanks all can play a role in promoting peace and understanding. Events like this can be useful forum to promote the message of peace. Such an effort carries greater attention when it is held at the birth place of Lord Buddha.
I wish the organizers of this event all success in this endeavor.
I thank you all.

Closing Remarks by Minister for Foreign Affairs Hon. Mr. Pradeep Kumar Gyawali at the 24th AFID Conference on Intellectual Disabilities
Posted onDecember 6, 2019December 8, 2019 

Kathmandu, 6 December 2019

President of Asian Federation of Intellectual Disabilities,
Chair of the organizing Committee of this Conference,
Delegates, panelists and participants of the conference,
Friends from the media
Ladies and Gentlemen.
Namaskar and Good Evening!
Let me thank the organizers for inviting me to this event. It is a privilege and honor to be here today. I feel close by heart to both the issues and people that this conference was dedicated to.
I thank the AFID for choosing Kathmandu as the venue of this conference. I welcome all international participants in Nepal.
Trust that you have had a comfortable stay and a productive and fruitful outcome.
As you wrap up the conference, I am sure that you had sufficient opportunity to deliberate on the theme of the conference- “Equity, Equality and Inclusion of People with Intellectual Disabilities”. This seems to be a thoughtfully chosen theme which should receive high importance from the Governments, civil society, private sector and the media alike.
According to WHO estimation, about 15% of the world’s population lives with some form of disability and about 200 million people have an intellectual disability.
We must recognize that to be intellectually disabled is not an individual’s choice. It transcends the boundaries and is found in all societies, economies and religions. They are just people with different abilities and we have to support and encourage unleashing their potentials. They are members of our family, our sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, uncle and aunts, very much part of our society.
They are right-holders and are entitled every right and benefit that all other members of our society enjoy. They are subject of equal protection of law. We can make an equitable and inclusive society only when we walk the road together.
Let me quote a statement by Stephen Hawking.
“We are all different, but we share the same human spirit. Perhaps it’s human nature that we adapt and survive.”
Unquote.
This group of people requires support, respect, and special enabling provisions to be fully able to enjoy their rights. Socio-psychological and emotional support stands very important. Such a support and special provisions should begin at home and extend to the community and State at large.
It is a responsibility of every civilized and democratic society to render special provisions to the persons with disabilities in general and persons with intellectual disability in particular. All other stakeholders in the society also have their role to play. I am confident that this conference has been able to come up with recommendations to be implemented by all of them.
Ignorance and poverty stand as impediments to the protection of persons with intellectual disability. Therefore, greater awareness, creation of supportive environment, provision of adequate resources and programmatic interventions at all levels should be our priority.
Inclusion of persons with disability becomes critical not to leave anyone behind as we gear up to the implementation of transformative sustainable development goals. We have to encourage them to mingle with, engage in enterprises, let them learn language, speak and communicate in the language they feel comfortable and let them gain vocational training and skills for self-empowerment.
At community level, rehabilitation centers, teaching and learning centers, health and sports centers, cultural programs could be the healing tools. More than that, love, care and affection strengthen their morale to overcome the hardships.
Ladies and Gentleman,
Let me briefly share with you what we have been doing in Nepal with regard to ensuring equity, equality and inclusion of the persons with disabilities in general and persons with intellectual disabilities in particular.
Nepal is a State party to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) and has submitted its periodic report well in time. We are now implementing the recommendations of the CRPD Committee.
The Constitution of Nepal is founded on the ideals of equality and non-discrimination. It has guaranteed comprehensive sets of human rights, including for the persons with disabilities.
Discrimination on the basis of disability is strictly prohibited. They have the right to live in dignity and honor. They have the rights to inclusion, social justice, social security, education, participation in the State institutions and right to access to public services and benefits.
Special provisions have been made for their protection, support, empowerment and development as well as to ensure their access to education and enhance representation.
To implement those rights enshrined in the Constitution, a comprehensive Disability Rights Act was enacted in 2017 in compliance with the CRPD.
The Act fully adheres to the right-based approach, recognizes diversity within the disability, eliminates derogatory words, and criminalizes the use of such words.
It also creates institutional mechanism to coordinate, monitor and promote the effective implementation of those rights at all levels of government.
We have introduced National Policy and Plan of Action on Disability (NPPAD) which is under implementation now.
Nepal’s culture and family values strongly encourage taking care of the differently able members within the family.
The Government of Nepal has also undertaken some key programmatic interventions with a view to implementing the constitutional and legal provisions.
Interventions, such as, promotion of community-based rehabilitation, production and distribution of assistive devices, provision of ID Cards, social security allowances, and full tax exemption to assistive devices, vehicles, and wheelchairs are some of the most utilized provisions.
In addition, monthly welfare allowance is paid to persons with profound and severe disabilities including the children. Scholarships and incentives such as residential scholarship; device and support scholarship; transportation subsidies; and motivational scholarship have been provided.
The Government provides resources to disabled peoples’ organizations to implement targeted programmes and support the people with psychosocial disabilities through counselling, treatment, rehabilitation and reintegration.
Mental health medication is included in the list of essential drugs that the Government makes available through the local health facilities. A separate Mental Health Policy has been approved to address the issues related to the persons with intellectual disability.
For over 13 years, Nepal has been implementing special reservation system in public sector employment opportunities to the persons with disabilities and has encouraged private sector for the same through tax incentives. Income tax threshold for persons with disabilities has been extended by 50% in comparison to others.
We have created institutions at different levels to exclusively work in the interest of the persons with disabilities.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
While sharing these positive efforts on the part of the Government, I am equally aware of the unique challenges that Nepal is confronted with in the way of protecting rights, interests and welfare of the persons with disabilities. The mountainous terrain of the country, high risk of natural disasters, modest level of technological development and capacity to afford modern assistive devices account some of the challenges that we face today.
We have endeavored to address those challenges through mobilization of all three tiers of government and enhancing partnership with civil society organizations and development partners. We need to invest more resources on infrastructures and technology.
To conclude, I am confident that the outcomes of this conference will provide useful ideas to calibrate and further reinforce our efforts and help to strengthen the partnership among the government, private sector, academia, media and social society for the common cause of supporting and enabling persons with intellectual disabilities.
I thank you all for your kind attention.

Dr. Md. Mozzamle Haque Khan, President of JICA Alumni Associations’ Forum of SAARC Countries (JAAFSC),
Friends from Media,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Good Morning and Namaskar!
First of all, I would like to extend my thanks to the organizer for inviting me as the Chief Guest in this esteemed gathering of 46th Annual Function of JICA Alumni Association of Nepal (JAAN).
I am pleased to know that JAAN in collaboration with JICA Alumni Associations’ Forum of SAARC Countries (JAAFSC) is also organizing an international seminar on ” Disaster in South Asia: Interventions, Challenges and Lessons Learnt” on this occasion.
I am also delighted to know that representatives from JICA Alumni Association of all SAARC countries are participating in this program. I have also learnt that JICA Office Representatives of a few SAARC countries are also here in this august gathering. I welcome all of you to this historic and beautiful city of Kathmandu and wish for your pleasant and fruitful stay.
Dear Friends,
Nepal and Japan have been enjoying excellent bilateral relations based on friendliness, understanding and mutual cooperation ever since the establishment of formal diplomatic relations in 1956.
Our shared cultural values based on Buddhism has played an instrumental role in deepening ties at peoples’ level.
Exchange of high-level visits at different levels have greatly contributed to further enhancing our bilateral relations. In this context, I would like to recall the recent visit of Rt. Hon. Mrs. Bidya Devi Bhandari, President of Nepal, to Japan to attend the Enthronement ceremony of His Majesty the Emperor of Japan. On that occasion, the President of Nepal and Prime Minister of Japan exchanged views on wide ranging issues of bilateral interests. I myself paid an official visit to Japan in November 2018 followed by the visit of Japanese Foreign Minister to Nepal in January 2019. These visits have buttressed the edifice of our bilateral relations to our mutual benefits.
Japan has been a longstanding development partner of Nepal. It has supported Nepal towards her overall development efforts. Japan’s cooperation encompasses human resources development, education, health, road and other infrastructural development, agricultural development and horticulture, including vegetables and fisheries. Japan has also helped Nepal in the social development of the country.
Each year the government of Japan has been offering scholarships to the Nepalese government officials and students. Moreover, the Japanese Volunteers have been supporting the government and local communities through their expertise in agriculture, traffic management and human resources development and so on.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I am happy to learn of the joint organizing of seminar today by JAAN and JAAFSC on natural disaster management focusing on South Asian experiences and challenges. This is a welcome initiative.
Considering the occurrence of different hazards as regular phenomena in South Asia, this seminar is going to be very useful, timely and relevant. The findings of the seminar, I believe, will be beneficial for all the governments in South Asia as well as other concerned including academia.
Nepal as a party to the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 strongly emphasizes disaster risk management and hopes for the engagement at all-of –society and all-of –State institutions’ levels.  We are committed to translate the Seven Global Targets and Four Priorities for Action defined by the Framework as far as practical.
Though a voluntary and non-binding agreement, the framework believes that the State has the primary role to reduce disaster risk by sharing the responsibilities with other stakeholders including local government, private sector and other stakeholders.
In line with global and regional framework and best practices of the friendly countries, Nepal has also put in place some key policies, acts and action plans, including Disaster Risk Reduction National Policy, 2075, Disaster Risk Reduction Management Act, 2074 and Disaster Risk Reduction National Strategic Action Plan, 2018-30. Our current national plan envisions ensuring resilient and safe Nepal from disaster risk.
The Government is expediting the configuration of institutional arrangements at federal, state and local levels to enable the stakeholders’ proactive and coordinated participation in disaster risk management.
Dear Friends,
The physiographic settings and the climatic characteristics of the South Asian region is favorable for the high incidence of both geological and hydro-metrological hazards. Countries of the South Asian region are vulnerable to different calamities like drought, flood, glacier melting, land sliding, cyclones, earthquakes, windstorms etc. South Asian Region has a history of devastating earthquakes, floods, landslides, droughts and cyclones that have caused economic and human losses.
South Asia is extremely vulnerable to natural disasters; over a thousand major events such as landslides, glacial lake outburst (GLO) and avalanches, floods and drought, storms were reported within the past four decades.  It is important to note that marginalized groups e.g. women, the poor and indigenous people are most vulnerable to climate risks.
Fast melting Himalayas pose serious risk for water resources in the region. Subsistence of very large population, around one fifth of global population, is based on Himalayas’ snow -fed rivers in the South Asia.
Moreover, Nepal is situated in the seismically active Himalayan mountain belt dominated by the northward movement of the Indian tectonic plate towards and below the Eurasian tectonic plate.
In retrospect, I still recall the horrible devastating earthquake that hit Nepal in April, 2015.  JICA, our long-term development partner, has been helping Nepal for post-earthquake recovery and reconstruction in the main priority areas such as School and Housing Reconstruction, Public Infrastructure, Cultural Heritage, Livelihood Recovery and Recovery Planning and Disaster Preparedness.
I am happy to share that despite of unimaginable damage caused by devastating earthquake, the post-quake reconstruction in our country is moving ahead fast and smoothly, in the spirit of building back better. The reconstruction of more than 8,00,000 individual houses is in the final stage and similarly, the reconstruction work of heritages, school buildings, hospitals and  government offices is also moving ahead. We are confident that reconstruction process will concluded within next two years.
Taking seriously the alarming challenge caused by climate change, Nepal is going to host a global dialogue Sagarmatha Sambaad under the theme of climate Change, Mountains and Future of Humanity in April 2020. We are hopeful that this Sambaad will provide us a platform for intensive deliberations, sharing and knowledge generation for sustainable and resilient development model and green economy.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I am really moved by the fact that JAAN is a professional body with highly motivated members and Executive Committee. It is committed to the implementation of its calendar of operation. It has been contributing to strengthening good relation between Nepal and Japan and in the nation building through its several activities.
I appreciate the contributions made by JAAN in strengthening ties between Nepal and Japan. Moreover, its contribution in the revival of JAAFSC has also been laudable. I encourage JAAN to continue its efforts in nation building especially through community development initiatives.
Dear Friends,
I am confident that this seminar would serve as a forum for strategic communication of opinions of experts to the larger audience of our region. I wish once again all the best for the successful completion of the JAAN’s Annual Function and international disaster management seminar.
I am sure that your stay in Kathmandu will be productive, enjoyable and memorable.
I thank you all for your kind attention.

Remarks by Hon. Pradeep Kumar Gyawali, Minister for Foreign Affairs at a reception held at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations
Moscow, 26 November 2019
H.E. Anatoliy Vasilievich, Rector, Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO)
Distinguished faculty members,
Dear students,
Distinguished Guests,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
First of all, I extend to you all warm greetings on behalf of the Government and people of Nepal and on my own.
My sincere thanks go to the Institute of International Relations for organizing today’s programme. The Institute’s continued partnership with the Embassy of Nepal at different forums reflects nothing but true affinity, close academic interaction and growing people-to-people exchange.
It is my distinct honour to meet with the faculty, students and researchers of this Institute of high repute here in Moscow on the occasion of my official visit to the Russian Federation.
I have heard a lot about the extraordinary contributions of MGIMO in the articulation of Russian foreign policy. As alma mater of top Russian diplomats, intellectuals and politicians, I commend your stellar performance, particularly in enhancing the scope of research and knowledge base in the field of contemporary global politics.
I am very pleased to be present amongst you to exchange our views and experiences on how we can best contribute from our respective sides to further strengthening the already warm bilateral relationship between Nepal and Russia.
We greatly value the continued dialogue and exchange by engaging all walks of life and different sectors of development. I offer my sincere appreciation to you all for playing an active role in strengthening multi-faceted ties that exist between Nepal and the Russian Federation.
Nepal and the Russian Federation are old and good friends. Ever since the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1956, we have maintained cordial and friendly relations. This year marks the 63rd anniversary of the establishment of formal ties. I would like to extend warm felicitations to all of you on this happy occasion.
Esteemed Friends, 
In my presentation today I will briefly touch on three key aspects: Nepal-Russia relations; Nepal’s foreign policy orientation in the changed context; and Nepal’s development journey ahead and our priorities.
Let me first  pick up Nepal-Russia relations.
Nepal greatly values the bond of friendship it enjoys with the Russian Federation. Our relations have progressively evolved over the years to cover political, economic, social, cultural and educational dimensions. It is a multidimensional partnership.
Continued engagements at various levels and mutual cooperation in the areas of common interest have nurtured our friendship.
Parliamentary and judicial exchanges and frequent visits by high officials of both countries have contributed to widening the scope and enriching the substance of our relationship.
The objective of my visit this time, in my capacity as Foreign Minister of Nepal, has been to bolster trust, deepen political understanding, promote economic, commercial and cultural ties and strengthen collaboration in dealing with regional and global issues of common concern.
In this light, Foreign Minister Lavrov and I exchanged substantive views on a wide range of topics during our official talks yesterday. We agreed to work together to take our relations to the next level through enhanced political engagement and promotion of mutually beneficial cooperation in diverse fields. We underlined the importance of exchanging high level visits between the two countries, activating established bilateral consultation mechanism and concluding a host of agreements and understanding to further cooperative partnership.
I am satisfied with the outcome of our discussions and our consensus on the road ahead to realize the full potential of our mutual cooperation.
As you are aware, my visit has taken place in the fundamentally changed national context of Nepal. Nepal’s long political transition following a decade-long armed conflict has ended. A new democratic and inclusive Constitution promulgated in September 2015 has settled long-standing political issues. The elections held in 2017 under the provisions of the Constitution have produced a stable government with over two-thirds majority in the Parliament first time in two decades, thereby ending the cycle of political instability. Policy clarity and consistency in development efforts has been realized and the ‘Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali’ has been defined as country’s overarching national aspiration. A clear sense of direction and commitment in the conduct of an independent and balanced foreign policy based on the notion of ‘amity with all, enmity with none’ has underpinned our worldview.
This visit is also about Nepal’s commitment to reenergizing all aspects of multi-faceted Nepal-Russia friendship. Needless to say, the full spectrum of our friendship is much more than the formal contacts. There has been an increasing level of cultural cooperation and interactions engaging the private sector and other people-to-people exchanges. Students, entrepreneurs, diaspora, scientists, artists, mountaineers, tourists and importantly the academia from both the countries have made significant contributions.
People-to-people relations give added value to Nepal-Russia relations, which began with the visit of the renowned Russian Scholar Ivan Pavloviech Minayev to Kathmandu in 1875. It has been reinforced by Russian literary icons like Tolstoy, Chekhov, Gorky and Pushkin who have great influence in Nepali literature. It is heartening that many Russians have attraction towards the Hindu, Buddhist and the Eastern philosophy.
Some Nepali and Russian nationals are residing in each other’s countries for a variety of reasons. I thank the Russian community for hosting Nepali nationals and supporting them.  I also express my sincere thanks to the friendly Russian people for their help in the aftermath of the devastating earthquake in 2015. As Foreign Minister Lavrov told yesterday, the true friendship came into full play when Russia promptly and spontaneously sent a team of medical doctors along with humanitarian supplies for rescue and relief.
Ladies and Gentlemen, 
It is encouraging to witness continued progress achieved by the Russian Federation over the decades. In the fields of technologies, infrastructure, innovation and research, the progress has been remarkable. The Government, people and the academic circle of Nepal greatly appreciate these and many other stellar achievements made by the Russian Federation.
The steady course taken by Russia in achieving sustainable economic development, industrialization and high-end technological advancement have been glaring example of its perseverance and dedication. Over the decades, the Russian partnership with the global south has been increased.
Nepal sincerely appreciates support and cooperation extended by the Russian Federation in industrial and infrastructure development in the past. The technical cooperation has helped significantly lay the groundwork for Nepal’s economic development.
Nepal has learnt from Russia the development planning model.  Nepal adopted systematic and planned development efforts since 1956 and we have in place the 15th edition of the Development Plan. The best practices of the Soviet Planning model have helped Nepal shape its planning framework.
On a different note, Russian scholarships on higher education for Nepali students and public-sector professionals have been highly useful. There are a number of Nepali nationals trained in the Russian Federation occupying higher positions in politics, administration and the private sector today.
Nepal and the Russian Federation have been working closely in multilateral forums as well. One important avenue I would like to mention is the United Nations, which Nepal considers to be the cornerstone, custodian and emblem of multilateralism. With emphasis on a just and balanced world order for peace and stability, Nepal believes in multilateralism and rules-based international order.
At a time when the world is facing multiple challenges, the Russian initiatives in global fight against terrorism, cybercrime, climate change and other pressing global issues have been commendable. Let me underline that primacy of international law and value of world peace in the conduct of foreign policy help reduce tension and conflict.
Nepal has been contributing to the maintenance of the international peace and security by consistently and substantially supporting UN peacekeeping operations. Our troops are presently working in 15 out of 16 peacekeeping missions around the world and mostly in the troubled parts of the world. Russia, being a permanent member of the UN Security Council, has an important role to fulfill, together with other members, that peacekeeping missions accomplish their objectives in a timely manner within the given mandate. We call for enhanced consultation and coordination with TCCs/PCCs when taking important decision on peace missions.
Regional cooperation is one of the defining attributes of international relations today. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), founded jointly by the Russian Federation and other friendly countries in the region, is a new opportunity for institutionalizing a long-lasting environment for peace and prosperity in the region, and beyond. As a Dialogue Partner, Nepal has found SCO as an additional platform for engaging in mutually beneficial projects in a wide areas including trade, transit, investment, energy, agriculture, small and medium enterprises and culture. We are looking for a full-fledged membership of the organization to enhance our contribution. We are thankful to the Government of the Russian Federation that it was in Ufa, Russia, the decision to grant Nepal the dialogue partner status was taken.
Nepal has been collaborating, directly or indirectly, on matters of common interest with the Russian Federation in all available platforms. We will continue this in future.
Let me inform you, in this context, the Government of Nepal has established a permanent dialogue forum, Sagarmatha Sambaad (Mt Everest Dialogue) to deliberate on contemporary issues of national, regional and global significance. The first episode of this international dialogue platform will be devoted to the theme ‘climate change mountains and future of humanity’ and will be held on 2-4 April next year in Kathmandu. This will provide yet another opportunity for Nepal and Russia to strengthen partnership in the collective interest of humanity.
Distinguished guests,
Next aspect is Nepal’s foreign policy orientation.
Never colonized and subjugated, Nepal has always remained an independent nation. This speaks of our glorious history and evolution as a nation.
Our foreign policy orientation is very much influenced by this legacy. As I stated earlier, we pursue an independent, non-aligned, balanced foreign policy based on the philosophy of friendship and cooperation with all countries in the world. We do not believe in enmity. We do not nurture ill feelings towards anyone.
The UN Charter, the Panchasheel—the five principle of Peaceful Coexistence, non-alignment, respect for international law, value for world peace guide our foreign policy. We believe that respect for every country’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence and non-interference in the domestic affairs of other countries are the essential ingredients of healthy inter-state relationship.
As with any other country, Nepal also gives priority to its relationship with its neighborhood and extended neighbourhood. We have defined that our relationship with neighbours and other countries is based on the principle of sovereign equality, mutual respect and benefit. Guided by this principle, the present Government has made substantial efforts to enhance and consolidate friendly ties and cooperative partnership with neighbours and other friendly countries. It is our principled commitment which we are translating into action that we will not let our territory to be used against the interest of our neighbours and any other friendly nation. This has helped us earn confidence and trust of neighbours.
Our immediate neighbours happen to be the world’s two most populous countries and the fastest growing economies. It gives Nepal ample prospects for its economic development. We have the potential to be a vibrant bridge connecting the two sides for common benefits.
As a region full of potentials, diversity and challenges, South Asia should continue to engage in promoting the collective interest with utmost sense of regional solidarity, mutual respect and accommodation divergent views. We want peace and stability in our region and beyond. We believe that all differences can be resolved amicably through peaceful means.
Major powers, such as the Russian Federation, development partners and other friendly countries are in the priority of our foreign policy orientation. We have significantly enhanced our partnership with this group of countries. We are committed to further widen and deepen our relationship for mutual benefit. These countries are an important source of our development financing and trade relationship. Beyond neighbourhood, they are also a source of inbound tourists and technology.
The labour receiving countries are also in our priorities, as a large number of Nepali migrant workers are living there for employment. We are trying to diversify our relations with them to cover such vital areas as trade, investment, tourism and transfer of technology.
Regional cooperation features prominently in our foreign policy priority. We want to promote meaningful regional cooperation for the collective well-being of the people in the region. We attach importance to SAARC and BIMSTEC as principal vehicles for regional cooperation in our region. As I said earlier, we want to enhance our engagement in SCO. We are also pursuing the objective of sub-regional cooperation within the framework of BBIN-Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal. We are also a member of the Asian Cooperation Dialogue.
Our commitment to UN Charter is unflinching. We are a strong supporter of multilateralism. As discussed earlier, the UN is an indispensable global institution for us as it is the only legitimate organization which is capable of dealing with a host of contemporary issues we face today. Ours is an international perspective that believes in collective prosperity of mankind and rejects unilateralism. We stand for general and complete disarmament of all weapons of mass destruction. We support nuclear free zones and peace zones. We unequivocally condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.
We call for a just, harmonious, inclusive and peaceful world order where all nations enjoy their rights while fulfilling their obligations in good faith.
Economic diplomacy has been a key component of our overall diplomacy.  We are building economic partnership with friendly countries focusing on trade, investment, tourism, technology transfer, climate financing and decent jobs for migrant workers. Our diplomatic missions have been tasked to promote economic diplomacy to support our national drive for rapid yet sustainable development.
Distinguished friends,
Let me touch on the last component of my presentation. That is about our development priorities.
Economic transformation is our most important national task ahead. We are still an LDC.  We have additional difficulties as well. We are a country emerged from conflict and we are also a landlocked countries. This sums up the nature of our development challenges, which are of course manifold and complex.
Development is a national responsibility and we are fully aware of it. But our domestic resources are not sufficient to overcome our huge development challenges. And, we do not have luxury to wait for long, as we are lagging behind. We have to quicken the pace.
Our immediate goal is to graduate from LDC and become middle-income country by 2030 which is also the deadline for the realization of SDGs. We have envisioned a long-term plan to achieve national prosperity by 2041. We will redouble our efforts to realize the national aspiration of ‘Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali’ within this timeframe.
Towards realizing the national aspiration, we will expediate the process of economic development. While internal resources are important, we count on international support and goodwill to enhance trade performance and seek enhanced level of foreign direct investment. With a view to attracting foreign direct investment, we hosted an Investment Summit in Kathmandu in March this year. The Summit attracted a large number of prospective investors, including from Russia.
To make the business environment more attractive, friendly and competitive, investment related laws and institutions have undergone constant reform. For example, Foreign Investment and Technology Transfer Act (FITTA), Public Private Partnership and Investment Act, Special Economic Zone (SEZ) Act have been promulgated and One-Stop Service has already been operationalized. Some other legislative reforms are in the pipeline such as Intellectual Property Rights Act.
Nepal’s friendly investment climate is evident from the World Bank’s Doing Business Report. Its latest report ranks Nepal among South Asia’s most favourable countries for ease of doing business.
Nepal has huge hydropower potentials. Exploitation of this precious resource can change the economic face of our country and the region. Investment in this sector is highly profitable as there is no problem of market. Regulatory framework exists to facilitate export of power generated in Nepal to India and Bangladesh.
Agriculture, tourism, mines and minerals, infrastructure development and IT are some of the areas where investment can be highly profitable. We have a liberal investment regime that allows investment in almost all sectors. Negative list is very short. We also offer a range of incentives that are unique and special to our context.
At this juncture, Nepal has high hope of solidarity and support from our trusted friends. Your own involvement or encouragement to the business community to explore investment opportunities in Nepal would go a long way. Nepal is fully committed to protect your investments. Political stability gives policy stability, which is the fundamental element to ensure predictability in foreign investment regime.
At present the level of trade and economic engagement between Nepal and the Russian Federation stands at a modest level. Rather than staying discouraged with the figures, I think it should be taken as an opportunity to attain a higher and swifter level of trade, commercial and investment engagements between us.
It is upon us–the Governments, the private sector, academia and people of all walks of life–to strive for meaningful and substantive cooperation in all sectors, including trade, investments and tourism. There is a need to energize the role of Nepal-Russia Chamber of Commerce and Industries towards building business networks and kickstart doable projects in hand.
As you may be aware, Nepal is celebrating 2020 as Visit Nepal Year. An increased number of Russian friends to visit Nepal for tourism would greatly help the campaign. Nepal is a must-visit destination in one’s lifetime. Famous Poet Rasul Gamzatov was right when he described Nepal as ‘diamond yet to be crafted’. Investment in Nepal’s tourism infrastructure, which remains one of the lucrative areas, will also greatly help boost Nepal’s economy.
The Embassy of Nepal will work closely with you all, including the Non-Resident Nepali Association, Chambers, Friendship Associations and other partners, to make the Visit Nepal Year a success. As your good friend and also as the Foreign Minister, I would like to extend to you all a very warm invitation to visit Nepal at your convenience.
As I conclude, I once again appreciate you all for organizing this function and also for your kind presence. Ambassador Rishi Ram Ghimire and his team deserve my special appreciation for the hard work.
I am confident that today’s interaction will contribute to continue the momentum of our exchange and mutual understanding. This platform should continue to explore new ideas, academic exchange and avenues towards further enhancing Nepal-Russia relations in the coming years. I count on your support and solidarity.
I thank you.

Remarks by Honorable Mr. Pradeep Kumar Gyawali, Minister for Foreign Affairs at the International Conference on Protection of Rights of Migrant Workers
(12 November 2019, Kathmandu)
Chief Guest of the Conference Vice President Right Honorable Mr. Nanda Bahadur Pun,
Honorable Minister for Labour, Employment and Social Security Mr. Gokarna Bista,
Honorable Chairperson of National Human Rights Commission of Nepal Mr. Anup Raj Sharma,
HE Valerie Juilliand, UN RC
Honourable Members of the Parliament,
Honorable Dr. Carlon Alfonso Negret Mosquera, Chairperson of Global Alliance for National Human Rights Institutions,
Honorable Members of the National Human Rights Commission,
Hon. Chairpersons and Members of National Human Right Institutions of various countries,
Excellencies and Distinguished Delegates,
Representatives of Development Partners, United Nations Agencies, Private Sector, Civil Society, Academia and the Media,
Ladies and Gentlemen.
Namaskar and Good afternoon to you all.
It is a distinct honour and privilege to be at this important International Conference on Protection of the Rights of Migrant Workers organized under the auspices of National Human Rights Commission.
I would like to express my gratitude to the organizer for inviting me to share my thoughts at this important occasion.
Before I begin, I would like to extend warm welcome to all international participants to Nepal and wish for your comfortable stay.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Migration has been a defining phenomenon of our time.
We have seen migrant workers being important vehicle of high economic growth, infrastructure development and critical source to replenish the shortfall of working population in many countries.
Skills, knowledge and labor of migrant workers have been important force of production in the receiving countries and they provide critical human resources for agriculture, industries, trade and other sectors.
Migrant workers have also been the carrier of goodwill and source of co-existence and diversity in many countries.
On the other hand, the remittances sent by migrant workers have been significant source of income to their families back home that has played important role to keep economy of the countries of origin vibrant.
They have helped both the countries of origin and destination to strike balance between labour supply and demand; stimulate innovation, transfer skills and technologies; and assist to attain sustainable development.
If managed well, migration has a potential to create a win-win situation to all three parties in the process- the countries of origin, countries of destination and the migrant workers themselves.
According to UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, there are 164 million migrant workers worldwide in the year 2017. Data shows that annually 2.5 million Asian workers are leaving their country of origin in search of works to various destinations in Western Europe, US and countries in the Middle East.
As the number and demand for migrant workers increases worldwide, associated issues and challenges tend to surface in the process of recruitment, transfer, employment, social security and repatriation.
Most notably, in our own experience and from the experiences of elsewhere extrapolated from well-documented studies, the issues of low and discriminatory wages, unhygienic working conditions, violence and sexual harassments are some of the critical challenges faced by the migrant workers.
There are other challenges that further expose migrant workers to risks and vulnerabilities.
The issues such as low wages, exploitation, non-payment or delayed payment of wages, and cheating and malpractices in the recruitment process are some of the challenges that demand careful attention. Migrant workers tend to be vulnerable to human traffickers and smugglers. This is more severe among the low skilled labourers in comparison to the skilled workers.
All these factors have implications to the welfare, wellbeing and human rights of the migrant workers.
Often they do not find themselves in a situation to express their problems and seek redress through locally available mechanism under the laws of the host government. Lack of knowledge of local rules and regulations coupled with language barriers and cultural differences come as impediments for them to avail legal remedies and administrative grievance handling processes.
In recent years, there is growing international awareness about the challenges faced by the migrant workers and the need to respect basic human rights and welfare of this group of people.
Adoption of the International Convention on Protection of Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families in 1990 was an important achievement in this regard.
Similarly, negotiation and adoption of the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration (GCM) was another significant milestone towards holistically addressing the issues surrounding migration in general, including the migrant workers.
GCM provides a framework for cooperation to facilitate safe, orderly and regular migration and address the risks and challenges associated with the process. It offers sound way forward to decent job, health and safety at the workplace, non-discrimination in wage on the basis of gender, nationality and cultural difference of the migrant workers.
What is important at this stage is implementation of the agreed commitments contained in the GCM, engage in constructive dialogues and cooperation in addressing migrant workers related issues and enhance their welfare and protection.
Ladies and gentlemen,
A significant number of Nepali youths are living in different foreign countries as migrant workers. Therefore, the issue of migrant workers receives high importance in the policies and diplomacy of the Government of Nepal. Protection of the rights and interests of migrant workers, addressing the issues of exploitation and discrimination constitute critical areas of priority to the Government of Nepal.
A State party to various 24 human rights related international instruments and different ILO Conventions including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Nepal attaches high importance to issues of human rights of all people. Lord Buddha’s teachings of peace, humanity, compassion and oriental philosophy of human dignity, freedom and benevolence like सर्वे भवन्तु सुखिन: सर्वे सन्तु निरामया: (May all be happy, May all be healthy) deeply inspire us. We have abolished death penalty and practice non-discrimination as sacrosanct. We have built national institutions and necessary legal and policy frameworks for promotion and protection of human rights.
The Constitution of Nepal guarantees right to labour and right against exploitation. Our laws guarantee equal pay for equal value of work. The Foreign Employment Act, 2007 and its implementing regulations 2008 govern and regulate outward migration for foreign employment and rights and welfares of the migrant workers.
The Foreign Employment Policy aims at reducing risks and vulnerabilities of migrant workers and creating a safe, dignified and managed working environment.
The National Human Rights Commission, an independent national human rights institution, functions as oversight agency in areas of promotion and protection of human rights. We are glad to see that NHRC in recent years has paid equal attention to the rights and welfare of the migrant workers.
A member of UN Human Rights Council, we have played constructive, objective and impartial role for the promotion and protection of human rights of all around the world. We would like our people wherever they live and work as migrant workers enjoy rights equal to that of local population in the work place and receive equal economic and legal security from the country concerned.
In close coordination, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Department of Consular Services and Nepali diplomatic Missions abroad provide necessary services and protect interests and welfares of our migrant workers, including through rescue and repatriation services in time of difficulties.
Nepal attaches high importance to the attainment of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, including Goals 8 and 10 related to the migrant workers. While main thrust of the present Government has been to create employment opportunities at home for our youth, with a view to better protect rights and interests, provide safety and prevent unfair practices in the process of those going for foreign employment as migrant workers, the Government of Nepal has accorded priority to concluding bilateral labour agreements with the labour receiving countries.
As a significant number of our nationals work as migrant workers, Nepal remains keen to work with all stakeholders and partners for the protection and promotion of the rights, interest and welfare of migrant workers.
This requires close collaboration and cooperation between the countries of origin and destination. Other national and international stakeholders can add value in building synergies and effectiveness in our actions. The constructive role of recruitment agencies, private sector, civil society actors and the media is equally important.
Skills and capacity development, comprehensive pre-departure, on arrival and before return orientation to the migrant workers would help them understand their rights and responsibilities and the available remedial measures in case of violations. Use of information and communication technologies would be useful in protecting the rights of migrant workers.
A year after the adoption of the GCM, I believe this Conference would offer an opportunity to the participants for open and interactive dialogues in assessing the risks and challenges that the migrant workers are facing today and in exploring the ways to address those challenges in a cooperative and collaborative manner.
I wish to extend my best wishes for the success of this Conference.
I thank you all for your attention.

Points for Intervention for Minister for Foreign Affairs Hon. Mr. Pradeep Kumar Gyawali
at Panel Discussion under Plenary 1: From Kathmandu to Tokyo and Beyond – Committing to a Healthier, Better Nourished Future at Scaling Up Nutrition Global Gathering (SUNGG) 2019
(9:00 hrs, 5 November 2019, Hotel Yak & Yeti, Kathmandu)
Honorable Vice President, Honorable Ministers and high level dignitaries from the SUN Member Countries,
Her Excellency Ms. Henrietta Fore, Executive Director of UNICEF and Chair of the SUN Lead Group,
Her Excellency Ms. Gerda Verburg, UN Assistant Secretary-General, and Coordinator of the SUN Movement,
Members of SUN Business Network, SUN Civil Society Network, SUN Donor Network and UN Network for SUN,
Distinguished delegates and distinguished members of the Panel,
Representatives from Civil Society, Development Partners, United Nations Agencies, Private Sector Partners, Academia, Media, Parliamentarians and Delegates from different countries,
Ladies and Gentlemen.
Namaskar and a very Good Morning to you all!
First of all, let me welcome all distinguished delegates from SUN Movement Member Countries to Nepal and wish for your comfortable stay.
I would also like to thank the SUN Movement Secretariat for choosing Nepal as the venue of the global gathering this year.
And, I feel privileged to be at this important event today.
Today’s food for thought is that the food merely is not enough. It is the good nutritious food that makes people healthy, a pre-requisite for the development of a nation. Nutrition is the best investment for the future. Good nutrition provided during the first 1000 days determines the quality of life for the next 1000 months.
However, it is sad that millions of people around the world still lack enough food and many more eat poor quality diets. Malnutrition in all its forms continues one of the leading causes of poor health and poverty globally. We need to focus on developing sustainable food systems that have the potential to nourish human health as well as prevent environmental degradation. The theme “Nourishing People and Planet Together” is a fitting choice for this gathering.
Nepal and Scaling Up Nutrition Movement:
Nepal is one of the forerunners in the Scaling Up Nutrition Movement.
In 2010, within the framework of Multi-sectoral approach, Government of Nepal launched the Golden 1000 Days Initiative, a nationwide Public Awareness Campaign, in collaboration with different development partners.
For better nutritional outcomes among most disadvantaged children, in 2010, the Government of Nepal launched a nationwide targeted program of Universal Child Cash Grant to the Dalit children under five and children under five in five districts of Karnali, the remotest area in Nepal.
On 5 May 2011, Nepal became the fifth country to join the SUN Movement.  Ever since, Government of Nepal has taken various measures to scale up nutrition by developing coherent policy and legal framework; aligning programmes around a common results framework; developing a periodic financial tracking and results framework; and strengthening political commitments. The SUN Movement has proven to be a valuable platform to convene, mobilize, share, learn, advocate and drive a coordinated approach to ending malnutrition.
Nepal was also one of the countries that launched the ‘Renewed Efforts Against Child Hunger and Under-nutrition (REACH)’ initiative in 2011 aiming to strengthen nutrition policies and procedures in alignment with the multi-sectoral approach.
Challenges of achieving Sustainable Development Goal 2
The Sustainable Development Goal 2 aims to end hunger by 2030 and ensure access to safe, nutritious and sufficient food for everyone, all year round, thereby ending all forms of malnutrition.
In Nepal, we have challenges to reduce number of stunted, under-weight, wasted and under-nourishment and anemia among the children and women. Conversely, for a growing number of children, obesity has become an emerging challenge – contributing to the double burden of malnutrition.
The proposed targets for Nepal for SDG 2 include a reduction in the prevalence of undernourished to 3 percent and the reduction in the prevalence of underweight children – under five years of age –to 9 percent by 2030.
The other targets aim to reduce the prevalence of anemia among women and children and increase per capita food grain production.
Enabling institutions, strengthening partnership, creating conducive environment and encouraging more investments are essential to achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The Government of Nepal is making every effort to scale up nutrition and deliver for their people a place free of malnutrition by 2030.
The Multi-sector Nutrition Plan
The Government of Nepal is fully committed to achieving Sustainable Development Goals and the World Health Assembly targets related to nutrition. While our efforts to tackle malnutrition began much earlier, it gained considerable momentum after joining the SUN Movement in 2011.
In 2011, the Nutrition Assessment and Gap Analysis was carried out and endorsed by the Government which led to the development of the Multi-Sector Nutrition Plan in Nepal. While the first plan covered the period from 2013 to 2017 and integrated different sectors from agriculture and water and sanitation to education and governance, the second Multi-Sector Nutrition Plan – for the period of 2018 to 2022 – builds on the firstplan and is being implemented throughout the country. The second plan places emphasis on achieving nutrition-related Sustainable Development Goals for Nepal. The second plan:

focuses on gender empowerment and equitable emphasis on populations disproportionately affected by malnutrition;
takes a life cycle approach, starting with the first Golden 1000 days;
aims to forge a strong relationship with the 753 local governments and provides a special directive on operationalization of MSNP in the context of federalism;
gives a stronger emphasis on monitoring and accountability for implementation; and
establishes a strong link with Universal Child Cash Grant for better nutritional outcomes.

The estimated budget of implementing MSNP II is nearly USD 500 million, out of which, the government will be contributing 60 percent and development partners are contributing 40 percent to implement the Plan.
The Constitution of Nepal enshrines the right relating to food and health. For this, we have been focusing on reducing the poverty and inequalities among the women and marginalized ethnic and caste groups; prioritizing actions for the poorest and most vulnerable people to ensure that no one is left behind and to follow the principle of universality without any discrimination.
Way forward and commitments
The Government of Nepal aims to meet the Sustainable Development Goals and World Health Assembly targets along with the targets set by 15th periodic plan of Nepal through a number of key commitments:
Commitment 1: Increasing investment to eliminate all forms of malnutrition and ending hunger::
The government of Nepal remains committed to expanding nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive programmes nationwide by 2020 under the framework of the Multi-Sector Nutrition Plan, benefiting more than three million children under the age of five through nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive interventions; providing iron-folic supplementation to all 3.5 million adolescent girls and 1.9 million pregnant and nursing women. The total budget for the Plan is nearly USD500 million, but there is an urgent funding gap of approximately USD200 million. We urge our partners to help us fill this critical gap.
Commitment 2: High-level political commitment to tackle impacts of the climate and environment related crisis:
Nepal is prone to natural disasters such as earthquake, floods, landslides and avalanche. We are one of the climate vulnerable countries. To tackle the food and nutritional challenges that are consequently affected, Nepal will formulate and implement a robust policy and strategy by 2020 in a coherent and integrated fashion that strengthens humanitarian development drive.  This includes a social protection and sustainable agriculture system for sustainable nutrition impact.  The Government of Nepal is committed to developing a strong policy framework connecting Disaster Risk Reduction with regular ongoing nutrition programs at federal, provincial and local government levels to mitigate adverse effects of the different types of natural disasters, shocks on nutritional outcomes.
Commitment 3: More nutrition-sensitive and nutrition specific research and development: Considering the climate and environment related crisis, the Government of Nepal will prioritize agricultural and other research and development with stronger focus on nutrient-dense foods such as fruits, vegetables and legumes, treatment of severe and moderate acute malnutrition, control of micro-nutrient deficiencies, and Infant and Young Child Feeding and Care in a life cycle approach. Appropriate policy measures will be initiated by 2022 to significantly promote production of nutrient-dense and locally grown traditional foods. The implementation of the Right to Food and Food Sovereignty Act will be further promoted. 
In addition, the Government of Nepal will review existing policies and ensure key policy measures are in place to tackle the impact of the climate related crisis and improve the resilience of rural production systems and value chains – while managing a sustainable increase in its goods and services. We will also ensure the environmental sustainability while promoting the technology transfer in agriculture.
Commitment 4: Investing resources to strengthen advocacy and awareness around all forms of malnutrition including under-nutrition, obesity and micronutrients deficiencies.
By 2020 the Government of Nepal will endeavor to develop policy measures to address adverse effects of processed and packed foods on nutrition, especially on infant feeding, micronutrients deficiencies and overweight/obesity.
To conclude, let me emphasize that this Global Gathering has provided an opportunity to reinforce the government’s commitment to eliminate all form of malnutrition including emerging nutrition challenges due to climate related crisis, changed lifestyle and processed foods as well as to achieve the World Health Assembly Targets 2025 on nutrition and Sustainable Development Goals 2030. This has also been a platform to promote new investment in this critical area and to provide clear strategic direction for the future.
I believe this is an excellent opportunity to share our stories – our achievements in nutrition and the challenges we collectively face. This is also a forum to renew our commitment and pave the way for the next phase of the Movement both at the country level, and 2020 Global Nutrition Summit, Tokyo.
I thank you for your attention.

“Upholding the Bandung Principles to Ensure Concerted and Adequate Response to the Challenges of Contemporary World”
Statement by Right Honourable Mr. K P Sharma Oli, Prime Minister of Nepal and Leader of the Nepali delegation to the 18th Summit of Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) 
Baku, Azerbaijan, 25-26 October 2019
Your Excellency Mr. Ilham Aliyev, President of the Republic of Azerbaijan, Chairman of this Summit,
Excellencies,
Distinguished Delegates:
Namaste, Salam and Good Morning/ Good Afternoon!
I congratulate you, Mr. Chairman, on your assuming the Chair of our Movement. I am confident that the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) will reach a new height under your able leadership.
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the Government and people of the Republic of Azerbaijan for the warm welcome and generous hospitality extended to us.
The outgoing chair, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, deserves our appreciation for successfully steering the Movement for the last three years.
I have brought with me greetings and best wishes from the land of Buddha and Sagarmatha (Mt. Everest) for the success of the Summit.
Mr. Chairman,
Sixty-four years ago, the leaders from Asia and Africa assembled in the Indonesian town of Bandung.
They assembled for a specific purpose and that was the need of the hour.
They developed new set of principles to govern relations among nations.  Those principles were:
–  about respecting and observing in good faith the principles of UN Charter,
–   about supporting national independence,
–   about upholding of sovereign equality, territorial integrity and non-interference in the internal affairs, and
– about settlement of all disputes through peaceful means.
These principles are so sacrosanct and have timeless value that if we fail to observe them the world order will turn into anarchy.
And, this is certainly not the objective of humanity.
The objective is to respect them, which makes the world peaceful, safer, stable and prosperous.
The Non-aligned Movement (NAM) was conceived as a decisive response to unjust and unfair world, a dehumanizing world where the basic essentials of human being- the freedoms were denied and brutally suppressed.
It was conceived to defend fundamental rights of the peoples and the nations in the South.
It was a thoughtful decision to practice an independent foreign policy based on objective analysis of the worldview, away from biased judgement in an international environment that was characterized by intense east-west rivalry, the Cold War.
In doing so, we wanted to preserve our autonomy in decision-making, which is the soul of sovereignty. 
Mr. Chairman, 
The Bandung principles, which are eloquently manifested in the objectives of the NAM, form the fundamentals of our foreign policy as enshrined in our Constitution.
We take immense pride in saying that the five principles of peaceful co-existence better known as Panchasheela, were derived from the teachings of Buddha, the immortal son of Nepal.
They make a perfect sync with the essence of Nepal’s foreign policy principle that believes in ‘Amity with all, enmity with none’. 
Mr. Chairman,
Nepal’s experience presents a testimony of how peace, democracy, development and human rights are closely interlinked.
Human rights can find true meaning only in a condition of comprehensive democracy.
One would ask what is the essence of comprehensive democracy?
I stand for a holistic empowerment of individual so that he/she enjoys freedom from poverty, access to equal opportunity, right to life, security and dignity.
I would say the political rights alone are not sufficient to empower individual in the true sense of the term. They remain useless if a person remains hungry and homeless, which threatens his most fundamental right – the right to life.
Being cognizant of the fact, we in Nepal have crafted social security system to cover the entire cycle of human life so that no one dies due to lack of food and shelter.
Beyond the borders, comprehensive democracy must be practiced at the global level as well.
How do we promote this?
We promote this by ensuring sovereign equality, non-use of threat or force, non-interference in internal affairs, respect and dignity of all nations, non-exploitation, and fair opportunities for all countries to grow and develop.
Comprehensive democracy demands a world order:
–   that is democratic,
–   that is inclusive,
–   that is just,  and
–   that is fair.
Unless and until we achieve it, the NAM will continue to be relevant for us. The NAM is a synonym for peace, security, justice and development.
It has time-tested value and appeal. 
Mr. Chairman,
Mother earth is common to all and has bestowed enough to fulfil human needs in a rational way.
We cannot live in a situation where excessive greed and intolerable destitution stand in two opposite extremes.  Excessive greed is the primary reason for environmental catastrophe as well as the social conflict.
We must therefore ensure:

prosperity for all so that no one is left behind as the SDGs have underlined; and
protection of mother earth so that the needs of the future generations are not compromised.

How we achieve this?
We achieve this by ensuring global justice in such a manner that all states enjoy their rights and fulfil their obligations in a balanced manner.
However, in judicious utilization of natural resources, there should not be any restriction on the sovereign choice of the people.
Climate change has assumed crisis proportion.
Being acutely aware of this fact, the Government of Nepal has decided to host the ‘Sagarmatha Sambad’, a global dialogue, under the theme of ‘Mountains, Climate Change and the Future of Humanity’ in April next year.
 Mr. Chairman,
In the interval of every three years we meet to make the assessment of the Movement. In every Summit we take decisions and define a new course of action. Our collective wisdom finds space in a comprehensive declaration that we adopt at the end of our gathering.
But let’s seriously ponder:
–   Have we ever developed the system to ensure that the decisions we made are implemented in good faith?
–   Have we ever tried to reach broad consensus that the political message of the Movement needs to be translated into action on the ground?
–   Have we ever analysed the deep rooted conflicts and differences among ourselves and tried to resolve them in the spirit of solidarity?
The time has come to seriously reflect on how could we collectively make the Movement more dynamic and effective.
Here are my humble suggestions:
–  We want to see a NAM that is internally cohesive, united, strong and externally influential so that entrenched global inequalities are uprooted for once and for all.
–  We want to see a NAM that fosters goodwill, understanding and cooperation so that division and discord do not surface to undermine the unity of the Movement.
–  We want to see a NAM that helps leverage the strength and capability of the South so that all developing nations build collective strengths to address development challenges to achieve shared prosperity.

We want to see a NAM that takes up burning global issues in a systematic manner and devises concrete solutions to address them.
We want to see a NAM that contributes to strengthening multilateralism with the United Nations at its centre.

I believe that the consideration of these suggestions will make a difference in the way our Movement functions in making the NAM truly a force to respond adequately to the contemporary challenges and to advance development journey for collective prosperity.
As a founding member of NAM, Nepal stands firmly to shoulder its responsibilities from the forefront.
I thank you all for your kind attention.

Statement by Honorable Mr. Pradeep Kumar Gyawali, Minister for Foreign Affairs 
at the NAM Ministerial Meeting
Baku, Azerbaijan 23-24 October 2019
Your Excellency Elmar Mammadyarov Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Azerbaijan
Honourable Ministers,
Excellencies, and Distinguished Delegates,
Ladies and Gentlemen.
I would like to begin by congratulating you on your unanimous election as the Chair of this Meeting.  I express my delegation’s full support in the discharge of your responsibilities.
I want to thank the Government and people of Azerbaijan for the warm welcome and generous hospitality extended to us. We are happy to be in this beautiful and historic city.
Let me also commend the leadership of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela for efficiently steering the Movement over the last three years.
Mr. Chair,
The founding fathers of the Non-Aligned Movement chose universal peace over conflict, uniting commonalities over dividing differences, shared prosperity over unequitable development and balanced multi-polarity over hegemonic bipolarity.
This Movement is an epitome of our collective pursuit for peaceful, just, fair and equitable world order. Drawing its strength from the Bandung Principles, the Movement has always led the path towards international solidarity and cooperation in the wake of ever-increasing challenges.
However, at present, our collective efforts to establish a peaceful and prosperous world are hindered by multiple challenges.
Poverty and hunger still exist as blemishes on human dignity. Achievements in scientific inventions, technological advances, and managerial innovations have not yet succeeded to soothe the pain of disease and deprivation. Fair distribution of economic development and prosperity remains a far dream for millions of people trapped into abject poverty.
The world economy has bounced back from Great Recession and has been achieving global growth since 2010 but it has failed to raise the hope of the bottom billion for a better future.
There is an unequal distribution of the benefits of globalization, which leaves the poor and vulnerable countries behind. These countries have become more vulnerable to the adverse impact of the financial and economic crises.
Increasing incidents of terrorism, transnational organized crimes, violent extremism, and hate speeches, among others, have become everyday phenomena.
The menace of climate change is outpacing our response. Unfortunately, it is the poorest and most vulnerable who are hit hardest by the impacts of climate change despite their negligible emissions.
Multilateralism has been under attack due to growing trends of populist nationalism and protectionism. We must strengthen the multilateral system by upholding and defending the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations (UN) and the principles of international law.
A strong, transparent and democratic UN would be an effective institution for global governance.
It is in this light that the relevance of NAM and its principles become more pertinent.
Mr. Chair,
Needless to say, peace and security and sustainable development have complementary and mutually reinforcing relationship.
No peace and security can ever be sustained without achieving sustainable development. Similarly, no sustainable development can ever be achieved without sustaining peace and security.
It is worth noting that money spent on prevention of conflict globally is much lower than the cumulative human, social and psychological costs incurred due to cyclical conflicts. Most of the countries suffering from the brunt of conflict and underdevelopment are the members of this Movement.
Conflict begets conflict and respects no national boundary. Arms race and conflicts dissipate the resources and arms add fuels to the conflicts.
Therefore, NAM, as a group of 120 countries, has a special responsibility to use its numerical and moral strength to ensure adequate and predictable resources in preventing conflicts and helping its members achieve peace and stability.
The NAM membership, in the spirit of solidarity, should support each other in building domestic capacity by sharing their experiences, best practices and resources through the South-South Cooperation mechanism.
Mr. Chair,
Nepal, as a founding member, believes that a stronger and revitalized NAM is a sine qua non for achieving peace, development and security.
The principles of NAM constitute the fundamentals of Nepal’s foreign policy. They are enshrined in our Constitution to guide our international relations.
Nepal believes that the principles of sovereignty and sovereign equality of States, territorial integrity and non-interference in the internal affairs of any State and pacific settlement of international disputes are the cardinal principles of the multilateral system.
Our Movement is for equal rights, equal opportunities, equal protection and equal respect for all countries.
The reforms in the international financial systems are also critically important for timely achievement of sustainable development goals. They need to be further democratized to make them more open, transparent and equitable.
Trade and investment are not just engines of growth but important tools to ensure inclusive growth and sustainable development. Therefore, the international trade and investment regimes should be universal, open, equitable, rule-based, predictable and non-discriminatory so all countries would be benefitted equitably.
Mr. Chair
Before I conclude, I wish to state that, after the success of our unique and home-grown peace process that culminated in the promulgation of the new constitution in 2015, Nepal’s priority now is on economic transformation and sustainable development.
Implementation of the 2030 Agenda is our national priority and is integral part to our graduation from the LDC status. We anticipate an enhanced, predictable and continued international support including from the NAM membership for a smooth transition and sustainable graduation.
While Nepal is committed to doing all it can, including in forging partnerships among public and private sectors at home, it looks forward to an increased cooperation and partnership with all our international partners for necessary resources, investment, technology and other forms of support.
Finally, I commend the progress made by the senior officials meeting on the Declaration and Outcome Document to be adopted by the 18th Summit of the Non-aligned Movement. I am confident that we will be able to have productive deliberations in this Meeting and contribute to making the Summit a historic one.
I thank you for your attention.

Speech by Honourable Mr. Pradeep Kumar Gyawali, Minister for Foreign Affairs at the reception organized by His Excellency Ambassador of Nepal to the Republic of the Union of Myanmar.
Yangon, 19 October 2019
The Rt. Honourable President,
Excellencies,
Friends from Media,
Distinguished Guests,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Namaste and Good Evening !
I wish to begin by thanking ambassador Udas and the Embassy family for hosting this reception in honour of the Rt. Hon’ble President Mrs. Bidya Devi Bhandari.
Let me covey to you warm greetings and best wishes from Rt. Hon’ble President, the government and people of Nepal, the land of Buddha and Sagarmatha.
We are delighted to have this wonderful opportunity to meet with Hon’ble Union Ministers, Provincial ministers, Mayors and representatives of other local authorities of the Union of Myanmar and the distinguished diplomatic community representing many governments around the world. We are equally delighted to meet with people from different walks of life , business community, faith organizations, media, members of Nepali community and of course, the friends and well-wishers of Nepal.
Thank you for your kind presence here this evening. We have taken this as your love and good will towards Nepal and Nepali people.
Nepal and Myanmar established formal diplomatic relationship in March, 1960. But the people to people to relationship has continued from hundreds of years. Nepal and Myanmar enjoy excellent bilateral relations which are not confined to official level, relations at the level of people are quite strong.
The Right Honourable President of Nepal Mrs. Bidhya Devi Bhandri is on a state visit to this great friendly country at the invitation of His Excellency U Win Myint, the President of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar. This is the first ever visit by the president of Nepal to Myanmar and by a Nepali Head of State in nearly four decades.
Rt. Hon’ble President of Nepal and His Excellency the President of Myanmar had fruitful discussions on further expanding and consolidating Nepal Myanmar relations that are age old and multi-dimensional. The Rt. Hon’ble President also had substantive discussions with Her Excellency the State Counsellor, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi that covered important aspects of Nepal Myanmar relations. In the course of past one year both countries have signed important bilateral instruments in the fields of trade and investment, tourism and culture.
Nepal’s foreign policy is guided by the principles of Panchaseel, charter of the United Nations, NAM and international law and norms of world peace. We have steadfast commitment to a rule based order. The overarching theme of Nepal’s foreign policy is “amity with all and enmity with none”.
The present government is committed to strengthening ties with neighbour as well as all other friendly countries in the world on the basis of the principles of sovereign equality, mutual respect and benefit. Regional cooperation is an important component of our foreign policy. We believe in multilateralism with United Nations at the center of global affairs.
Our diplomatic engagements have significantly increased recently resulting in substantial enhancement of cooperation with neighbours and other partners. Most recently, the President of China visited Nepal. The visit has been highly successful in elevating Nepal China relations to new height. We are expecting other high level visits in the near future.
I am pleased to inform you the Government of Nepal is hosting “Sagarmatha Sambad” (Everest Dialogue) in April 2020 in Kathmandu to galvanize international efforts to address the adverse impacts of climate change. We all are aware that the mountainous countries, small island developing states and countries with low lying coastal lands are among those hit hardest by the climate change which has assumed crisis proportion. We would expect participations from various countries including the countries you represent here.
Ladies and Gentlemen, you are aware that Nepal has undergone transformation of historic proportions. We have settled all political issues that we confronted for the last seventy years through the promulgation of a highly democratic and inclusive constitutions. The general elections held in 2017 produced a majority government thereby ending the cycle of political instability. We have achieved much needed political stability today.
Women are guaranteed 33% seats in the Federal and Provincial parliaments and 40% at the local level. Following the 2017, historic elections, the representation stands at 41% in all elected bodies. This is a major achievement in ensuring inclusive governance in the country.
Our focus today is on socio-economic transformation. “Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali” is our national aspiration and our development activities are guided by this aspiration. We aspire to become a middle income country and attain Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. We look forward to your continued support and cooperation in our efforts to realize these goals.
We are organizing visit Nepal 2020 next year to give tourism development a qualitative boost. We appeal to you to visit Nepal next year. Nepal has to offer many things both in terms of both nature and culture.
Lumbini is the birthplace of Gautam Buddha and the fountain of Buddhism. We look forward to receiving support and cooperation from friendly countries in our effort to develop it as a centre of world peace and learning. It is a common heritage of mankind which has enormous values for world peace and harmony.
In this respect, I would also like to inform that a new international airport in Lumbini, the birth place of Lord Budhdha, is on the verge of completion and will come into operation early next year. Excellencies, we have proposed to organize the United Nations International Day of Vesak in 2021 in Lumbini.
Let me conclude by saying I look forward to continuing an open and regular dialogue with you all about issues pertinent to your home country and to Nepal, via our mission stationed here and my ministry as well. As to my Myanmar brothers and sisters, I would like to express my gratitude for the warm hospitality extended to us. We are returning to our homeland with beautiful indelible memories and goodwill of people of Myanmar. With our shared values and common outlook, I have every confidence we will remain close partners and friends.
Thank You.

Statement by Hon. Mr. Pradeep Kumar Gyawali, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Nepal at the “Myanmar-Nepal Friendship and Business Opportunities” programme jointly organized by Myanmar-Nepal Friendship Association and Myanmar-Nepal Chamber of Commerce
Yangon, 19 October 2019
Mr. President, Myanmar-Nepal Friendship Association
Mr. President, Myanmar-Nepal Chamber of Commerce
Excellencies,
Distinguished Guests,
Friends from Media,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Namastey!
Min-ga-la-ba!
I am delighted to be here with you today. I have had similar privilege before but this one is special. Because our meeting is taking place on the occasion of the state visit of Rt. Honourable President of Nepal to Myanmar. It is a unique gathering, a perfect combination of business and friendship associations, both playing an important role in cementing friendly ties between our two countries. This certainly gives me an added pleasure.
Although Nepal and Myanmar formally established diplomatic relations six decades ago, both countries have maintained contacts for a very long period of time. Our ancient land links, marital associations, cultural similarities, deep respect towards each other, and practice of Buddhism have brought us closer. Myanmar nationals of Nepali origin have further strengthened our relations as a bridge. The friendship association has immensely contributed in nurturing people to people contacts which remains at the core of any bilateral relationship. I would like to see them working proactively to promote understanding, good will and cooperation between our two countries. Buddha’s eternal teachings of love, compassion and empathy influence daily life of the people in both countries.
Nepal had opened its Consulate in 1949 in Yangon, well before we established formal diplomatic relations in 1960. The establishment of diplomatic relations further cemented the bilateral relations.
Beyond the bilateral domain, Nepal and Myanmar are active members of BIMSTEC and Asian Cooperation Dialogue. This gives them an opportunity to collaborate to advance common interest within the framework of regional cooperation. We are of the view that countries in Asia should work together based on Oriental values and norms to contribute to development and prosperity for the entire Asian continent.
Talking in the multilateral context, even broader opportunities are there for them to work together in various multilateral forums such as United Nations, NAM, G-77. Today’s world where basic tenets of multilateralism are under attack, solidarity and unity among developing countries is essential to overcome the challenges of contemporary world and ensure a just, fair and rules based international order.
Let me reflect on the bilateral relations.
President Rt. Honourable Bidya Devi Bhandari is on a state visit to the Republic of the Union of Myanmar at the friendly invitation of His Excellency U Win Myint. This is the first ever visit by a president of Nepal and by a head of state of Nepal in nearly four decades. This visit assumes a special significance in the context of far reaching changes that our two countries have undergone in recent years. Our two countries have started the exchange of high level visits in recent years. I recall with pleasure the official visit of His Excellency Myint in August last year. We also had the privilege of welcoming the State Counsellor Her Excellency Aung San Suu Kyi in November. In one year alone, we have been able to conclude three important bilateral instruments in the fields of trade and investment, tourism and culture. These instruments carry immense importance in furthering economic and cultural ties between our two countries. We already enjoy strong political relationships.
Lumbini, birth place of Lord Buddha and fountain of Buddhism as well as world peace, is a sacred place for Buddhist around the world. Thousands of Buddhist pilgrims including from Myanmar visit Lumbini every year. Lumbini is more than a religious site; it is also a cultural treasure of humanity listed under the UNESCO heritage sites. I am happy to note that the Government and the People of Myanmar have contributed for the development of Lumbini. I would add one more fact in this connection; the pagoda built by Myanmar in Lumbini has remained a centre of attraction for Buddhist pilgrims from Myanmar and the world. It would be my remiss if I fail to acknowledge the outstanding contribution made by former Secretary-General of UN, U Thant, who hailed from Myanmar, for his for galvanizing international support for the development of Lumbini.
To facilitate tourists and other people, a new international airport is on the verge of completion. Once in operation the airport will greatly facilitate international travel to and from Lumbini. This will help realize the objectives of visit Nepal year 2020. This is only one dimension. Nepal has to offer a lot of unique things ranging from natural beauty as manifested by majestic Himalayas, flora and fauna to rich cultural treasures. Cultural diversity is our asset and peaceful co-existence is our way of life. We would like to welcome our friends from Myanmar to visit Nepal as our tourism products intend to meet the expectations of tourists of all kinds and for all purposes.
Mr. President,
With the successful promulgation of Constitution in 2015 and elections at all three levels of local, province and federal, we have a stable government in Nepal after decades. Now the Government has concentrated its focus on socio-economic transformation with clearly defined objectives of improving people’s standard of living and achieving higher and sustainable economic growth.
The overarching national aspiration that has guided our development vision and action is “Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali”. We intend to become middle income country by 2030 and achieve the SDGs by the same deadline. With the Government economic policies and constant hard work of the people, we have achieved 7.1 percent economic growth in the last fiscal year and we are likely to maintain this rate for the current fiscal year.
Nepal and Myanmar both are developing countries. We have common development challenges. We have a combined population of 83 million, which could be a big market. Our policies are liberal and our visa regime is also liberal. Therefore, I would like to urge the business community of Myanmar to visit Nepal and explore the opportunity for business.
The Government of Nepal is steadily and determinedly working towards building a business-oriented, investment-friendly environment in Nepal through various policy, structural, and legal reforms and introducing new market-friendly incentives and policies to make Nepal a profitable business destination. Foreign Investment and Technology Transfer Act has been thoroughly revised and updated and the Public Private Partnership and Investment Act has been promulgated to provide a sound regulatory framework for investment. Laws pertaining to intellectual property rights are under consideration for revision.
Nepal has trade and investment cooperation agreement with Myanmar. The Nepali businessmen are keen to work with the businessmen from Myanmar. Nepal’s Federation of Cottage and Small Industries (FNCIS) and Union of Myanmar Federation of Chamber of Commerce and Industries (UMFCCI) have signed a Memorandum of Understanding on the promotion of business between two countries.
The Government has opened almost all sectors for foreign direct investment. The negative list is very short. Our two countries have the advantage of huge markets in our neighbourhood. Moreover, regional forums like BIMSTEC offer a promising future for expanding trade and investment opportunities in the region.
Being an LDC, we have preferential access to some of the international markets.
We have untapped natural resources. We also have huge demographic dividend with 57 percentage of working age population. Every year over 500 thousand youths enter into job market. We have educated and trained working population. Combination of both makes investment in any sector in Nepal highly profitable. Hydropower and infrastructure development, agriculture, tourism, information technologies, manufacturing, mines and minerals have been identified as priority areas for investment.
Other incentives related to investment such as tax, foreign exchange, repatriation of capital, import, visa, land acquisition, company registration are quite attractive and the government has installed a one stop service to facilitate visa process in a time bound manner.
Disposable income of locals is increasing rapidly due to remittances from abroad, creating new local markets for products as well as new pools of talent within the labor market.
Dear Friends,
We successfully organized Investment Summit in March, 2019 and Infrastructure Summit in September, 2019. I recall the participation of His Excellency U Thaung Tun, Minister for Investment and Foreign Economic Relations at the Investment Summit. Both the summits witnessed active participation from many countries. Investment Summit saw investors pledging to finance several mega projects. The later summit saw extensive discussions focused on the global and regional megatrends, including climate change, and their relevance to the local context, issues surrounding infrastructure project delivery, financing modalities, and opportunities for cross-border economic cooperation and investments.
We understand that protection of your investment and reaping eventual profit is your priority. The Government of Nepal is fully committed and capable to protecting foreign investment with assured profit. We have formulated laws to protect your investment.
We have robust institutional set up that looks after investment in Nepal. Nepal Investment Board, chaired by the Right Honorable Prime Minister is a dedicated organization that looks after major investment projects. Similarly, the Department of Industry and Industrial Promotion Board have further strengthened existing investment mechanism.
As we look towards the future, I am confident that our common values and shared interests will continue to unite us. Our close relationship has only strengthened with time. We value cultural similarities that exist between our two countries. We value trade and business which are the bases of our economies but we also value our friendship and trust between our two nations and people. Let those values never diminish.
As our two governments have expressed strong determination to work together for enlarging the scope of economic cooperation, it is but natural that we expect our business communities to match the spirit and take concomitant efforts to realize the vision set forth by the government. My job here today is to appeal to the business communities of both countries to forge collaborative partnerships in realizing potentials that our two countries offer.
I would like to thank the organizers once again for this opportunity to address you all in this platform,
Thank you.

Statement by Hon. Mr. Pradeep Kumar Gyawali, Minister for Foreign Affairs at the Fourth Indian Ocean Conference
(Male, September 3, 2019)
His Excellency Mr. Ahmad Ali Al Sayegh, Minister for Economic Cooperation in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the United Arab Emirates, 
His Excellency Mr. Tandi Dorji, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Royal Government of Bhutan,
His Excellency M. Joaquim Jose Gusmao dos Reis Martines, Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries of Timor Leste,
Shri Madhav Rao and other Distinguished Members of the Organizing Committee,
Distinguished Delegates,
Ladies and Gentlemen:
Namaskar and good evening!
I have the great honour and privilege to address this Fourth Indian Ocean conference being held in this beautiful friendly country, the Maldives.
I would like to express my sincere thanks to the Government of the Maldives, the India Foundation and S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, Singapore, for organizing this Conference and inviting me to be a part of this important event.
The theme of the conference, Securing the Indian Ocean Region: Traditional and Non-Traditional Challenges, is highly relevant in view of the great significance of the Indian ocean and its security. 
The organizers deserve appreciation for creating such a prominent platform for deliberations on the theme of common interest.
I am here today bringing the best wishes of the people of the Land of Sagarmatha (the Mount Everest), the highest place on the earth, to the people of the deep Sagar (the Indian Ocean).
Excellencies,
We all are aware of the glory and magnificence of the Indian Ocean. This Ocean is the source of nourishment to a great number of human beings, animals and plants. It is also a bedrock for the development of great civilizations, cultures, and dynamic commercial and economic activities.
The vast ocean sprawling from Australia in the East to the Arabian Gulf to South Africa is replete with precious resources of one sort or the other.
It is an important passage for internal trade, as a large portion of such trade from the Pacific to the Atlantic and, in between them, passes through this region.
It is the route for trade of more than half of the world’s sea-borne oil, accommodating 23 of the world’s top 100 container ports facilitating one third of the global trade.
Likewise, 36 littorals and 14 adjacent hinterland states are related to the Indian Ocean, making more than 35% of the world’s population dependent on it. Thus, there is an inextricable linkage of these countries with this Ocean.
A large portion of the resources of the Indian Ocean region is yet to be explored. It is said that 16.8% of the world’s oil reserves and 27.9% of natural gas reserves find home in it. The abundance of huge resources has not only sustained life but also incessantly propelled trade and economic growth in the region.
Despite being a landlocked country, the major share of Nepal’s export and import trade is directly or indirectly dependent on transit through the Indian Ocean.
Distinguished Delegates,
With the opportunities come the challenges. The Indian Ocean and the surrounding region face a host of non-traditional security threats which include piracy, marine terrorism, climate change, illicit trafficking of drugs and weapons, human trafficking, natural disasters like tsunami, illegal migration, and interruption in freedom of navigation.
Many of these challenges have severely affected the countries associated with this Ocean. The island nations are facing existential threats due to climate change and consequent rise of sea level; unseasonal heavy rainfalls resulting into floods and landslides have been hitting Nepal and other countries every year taking a heavy toll of precious lives and property caused by the phenomena of global warming; similarly, threats of human trafficking, drugs and weapons smuggling and illegal migration have continued posing grave security threats.
In this context, it is appropriate to pursue collective actions from the countries directly or indirectly linked to the Ocean in order for addressing these challenges.
Moreover, maritime security of the Indian Ocean should receive a due priority by all the governments concerned.
It is important to note that the existing multilateral and regional architecture- Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA), ASEAN Regional Forum, East Asia Summit- have all prioritized cooperation in maritime safety and security, trade and investment facilitation, and disaster risk management.
In the South Asian region, initiatives taken such as this Conference will prove instrumental in forging cooperation in regard to strengthening the security of the region.
Excellencies,
In Nepal’s case, though Nepal is not directly linked with this Ocean, the country is associated with it, as major portion of Nepal’s international trade passes through it. It is bearing the brunt of the adverse impacts of climate change without being the cause for it. So is the case for the Maldives and some other countries.
Nepal believes that the rights of exploration, navigation and utilization of the resources of this Ocean can only be exercised when there is peace and security. Furthermore, it also holds that maritime security will continue to play a meaningful role in strengthening the Blue Economy, benefitting all the countries concerned.
Nepal is in favour of peace, prosperity and abidance of international laws in relations to the use of the high sea. It supports an architecture based on inclusiveness, partnership and collaboration among all countries and utilization of resources and sharing of the benefits by all states, including landlocked countries like Nepal.
I am confident that such arrangements would ensure the exploration, navigation and utilization of the marine resources, sharing the benefits and use of high seas to all states, including landlocked countries like Nepal.
In this context, I am happy to inform this august gathering that the Government of Nepal has been working towards implementing the vision of connecting Nepal’s mountains with the Indian Ocean with seamless connectivity of roads, railways and waterways.
Nepal is also in a process of bringing into operation its own commercial ships in international waters, hoisting Nepal’s Flag, in the near future. We believe it will involve us directly with the Indian Ocean with much more focus on international trade and transit.
There is one more dimension- the ecological interdependence between Himalayas and Indian ocean. In the context of climate change, the melting of glaciers results in the rise of sea-level which endangers the survival of low-lying island states. So, preserving the ecological balance in the Himalayas by addressing the adverse effects of climate change is in our common interest. The Himalayas have not only ecological values, they have been the source of civilization and repository of traditional and indigenous knowledge.
The Government of Nepal, with a view to sensitizing the international community on the impact of climate change on the livelihoods of people living in the mountains and low-lying coastal and island states, will be hosting a dialogue on Climate Change and Mountain Ecology in the first quarter of next year within the framework of newly established ‘Sagarmatha Sambad’. We will invite you attend the event once we finalize the details.
As to the exploration and utilization of the marine resources under the high seas, Nepal is yet to take full advantage of these resources.
Taking it into consideration, we urge the developed world for their support to the Land-Locked Developing Countries (LLDCs) to enhance capacity for reaping the benefits of the sea.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I am pleased to inform you that Nepal is in the process of developing in-land water ways in its big rivers in cooperation with India in a way to connect Nepal’s rivers with the sea for the movement of its export and import. It believes that effective waterways as a means of transport can greatly facilitate smooth, economical and fast trade and transit. Once Nepal is able to do so, it will also be effectively linked with the Indian Ocean.
At this moment, it would be relevant to recall the decision of the Fourth BIMSTEC Summit held in Kathmandu in 2018, which emphasized the importance of Blue Economy. The summit agreed to cooperate in this sector for the sustainable development in the region, paying due considerations to the special needs and circumstances of the landlocked Member States. I hope the agreement will be implemented in its true spirit, enabling the land-locked countries like Nepal to reap maximum benefits.
Distinguished Delegates,
When we discuss about the sea, we need to do it in a holistic manner. There is no doubt that maintaining security of the Ocean is of paramount importance. So is removing obstacles and addressing challenges of various sorts. What is more for the land-locked states like Nepal is to help remove their difficulties so that this natural handicap would not become an obstacle for their development.
Equally important is that the resources of and benefits from the oceans and seas should be equally shared with all countries associated with them. Then only we will create robust cooperation, including for their security and resolution of problems.
Nepal is ready to cooperate with all other countries associated with this region in strengthening security of the Indian Ocean and addressing the challenges facing it in whatever way possible.
Before I conclude, I, once again, would like extend thanks to the Organizing Committee for hosting this conference on a relevant theme which interests all coastal and landlocked countries.
I wish the conference a grand success!
Thank you!

Remarks by Minister for Foreign Affairs at a seminar on Nepal’s Foreign Policy: Orientation and Priorities
Posted onAugust 9, 2019August 9, 2019 


Remarks by Minister for Foreign Affairs Hon. Mr. Pradeep Kumar Gyawali at a Seminar on “Nepal’s Foreign Policy: Orientation and Priorities” organized by United Nations Association of Nepal
Kathmandu, 09 August 2019
Chairman of the United Nations Association of Nepal,
Excellencies,
Friends from the Media,
Ladies and Gentlemen.
At the outset, let me thank the United Nations Association of Nepal for hosting this seminar and inviting me to speak on this important theme.
Before I touch upon the subject matter of today’s seminar, let me briefly go through the background that shaped and inspired Nepal’s world view as it grew a consolidated nation state from the fragmentation that this region witnessed in the 18th century.
We are proud that Nepal is one of the oldest independent States in Asia. Nepal’s recorded history is a testimony of our practice of foreign policy with neighbouring countries even before the unification.
Prithiv Narayan Shah has eloquently articulated the unique geopolitical situation of Nepal in the metaphor of a ‘yam between two boulders’. Though the connotation and understanding of the “yam” has undergone significant change with the time, modern Nepal’s foreign policy draws on its underlying message ever since. Safeguarding of sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity were inherent in the ‘notion of yam’. Nepal even chose self-imposed isolation for over a century but retained her independence in the face of expanding colonialism in the region.
The political change of 1951 opened up the country and expanded our external outreach. Throughout the series of political upheavals and systemic transformation that followed in the past 70 years, basic tenets of our foreign policy remained consistent with necessary adjustments in its nuances and strategies.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
The Constitution of Nepal guides basic framework for the conduct of Nepal’s foreign policy. The Constitution also defines core elements of our national interest. Safeguarding of the freedom, sovereignty, territorial integrity, nationalism, independence and dignity of the country, border security, economic wellbeing and prosperity and the rights of the Nepali people are defined as the basic elements of Nepal’s national interest. It is intrinsic that service to the national interests is the primary objective of our foreign policy goal.
The Constitution also guides Nepal to pursue independent foreign policy and adhere to the principles of the UN Charter, non-alignment, Panchsheel, international law and the norms of world peace. Maintaining foreign relations on the basis of sovereign equality and enhancing dignity of the nation is an important element of our foreign policy.
These guiding principles have enabled us to take independent posture on international issues, articulate our views on merit basis, contribute to the world peace, and nurture friendship with all countries of the world.
Within the framework set by the Constitution, safeguarding of Nepal’s sovereignty, and independence and ensuring non-interference in the internal affairs of the country becomes a paramount priority for the Government in all of its external engagements.
We want amity with all, enmity with none, and consider international relations should be based on justice, sovereign equality, mutual respect and shared benefit. We want to promote Nepal’s credentials as an open, progressive, and democratic State.
We support multilateralism to promote a just and equitable international order in which all States- big or small- fulfil their international obligations in good faith, and enjoy equal opportunity to achieve their aspirations for development and prosperity. We consider that stability and predictability in the global order is essential for maintaining international peace and security.
A country transformed from armed conflict, we would be happy to share our hard-earned experience of successful nationally-led and owned peace process for the benefit of the countries in conflict or those in transition.
Having achieved internal political stability, we want to focus on the achievement of economic development with the overarching goal of ‘prosperous Nepal, happy Nepali’. Development imperatives at home guide our diplomatic engagements abroad. We have devised policies and national development plans accordingly. Focused pursuit of economic development agenda will remain a key priority of our economic diplomacy. Graduating from the status of LDC and attaining the middle-income status by 2030 are set as our milestones.
More recently, another dimension of Nepal’s standing in global stage has been added by expanding Nepali diaspora. A number of Nepali diasporas have excelled in the field of academics, science and technology, medicine, engineering, arts, designs, architecture, culinary skills, literature, industries, sports and adventures. Many of them have written their own success stories of entrepreneurship. They have individually and collectively contributed for the promotion of Nepal’s image in the world stage.
As a new initiative, the government has recently launched Brain Gain Centre at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to connect and attract knowledge, skills and expertise of Nepali diaspora to the service of the country.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Nepal has maintained friendly and cooperative relations with both of her immediate neighbours: India and China. Maintaining close and cordial relationship with them is our consistent priority. Our relations have expanded manifold in the sphere of political, economic, cultural, trade, tourism, investment, and people-to-people exchanges. We look forward to further strengthening of these relations. We admire our neighbours for their continued goodwill and support to our national aspirations and for their cooperation in the development efforts of Nepal. We consider the spectacular economic development of our neighbours as an opportunity and desire to benefit from that. We are conscious of the legitimate interests of our neighbours and will not allow any activity against them in our soil and expect the same from our neighbours.
Our relations with the countries in the extended neighbourhood are based on mutual respect, goodwill and understanding which we wish to sustain and consolidate. They are further nurtured by growing cultural and traditional ties. Our priority is to further explore, open up and diversify our relations especially in the areas of trade, investment, tourism and people-to-people exchanges.
Our relations with major powers and development partners have always remained cordial and cooperative. Their goodwill and support to Nepal in her development endeavour has been an enduring aspect of our friendship. We value this cooperation and remain grateful to our development partners for their continued support. While development cooperation from our partners through the Government channel in alignment with our priorities, leadership and ownership is important for us, we look forward to an enhanced level of investment and technology transfer. We continue to work towards enriching the substance of cooperation in our bilateral engagements with these countries.
Labour migration is an important issue for Nepal. A large number of our citizens are engaged in foreign employment and the remittances they send home make a sizable share of our economy. Therefore, it becomes Government’s priority to work closely with the countries of destination for safety, security and wellbeing of our migrant workers. In recent years our engagements with the labour destination countries have been more intensive and enriched by exchange of high level visits, and progressively growing trade and investment. We look forward to expand and diversify the scope of cooperation with these countries so as to encompass the broader areas of economic partnership involving trade, investment, tourism and civil aviation, among others.
Dear Friends,
Nepal is an ardent supporter of the rule-based and just multilateral system with the United Nations (UN) at its centre. We have abiding faith on the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and have adhered to them in letter and spirit.
As an active member of the UN, Nepal has contributed significantly for over six decades to the maintenance of international peace and security and protection of human rights. Nepal currently stands 5th largest troop and police contributing country in the UN peace operations.
Nepal attaches high importance to the protection and promotion of human rights. Human rights hold the centre stage in our Constitution. We are a State party to twenty-four international human rights-related instruments, including seven out of nine core Conventions. Nepal considers all human rights are universal, in-divisible, inter-dependent, inter-related and mutually reinforcing.
Currently Nepal is a member of UN Human Rights Council, and also serves as the coordinator of Asia Pacific group in the Council. We are a member of UN Peace Building Commission, Commission on Narcotic Drugs, Commission on Science and Technology for Development, Executive Board of UN-WOMEN, and Deputy Member of the ILO Governing Body. We are coordinator of Colombo Process of Labour Sending Countries and Chair of the Enhanced Integrated Framework Board of WTO. A Nepali expert is serving as a Vice Chair in the CEDAW Committee.
Nepal supports the UN reform initiatives with equal emphasis on all three pillars- peace and security, development and human rights- and to make the global body more efficient, effective and responsive to the need of our time.
Nepal stands for peaceful solution of international disputes. We support national leadership and ownership of any solution to internal conflict and apolitical role of the agencies like the United Nations.
Nepal continues to support total and complete disarmament of all weapons of mass destruction. Nepal condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and believes that terrorist acts cannot be justified on any ground whoever may be the perpetrator.
Nepal accords high priority to the issue of climate change, which is one of the biggest challenges of our time. We contribute negligible in the global greenhouse gas emission. However, as a mountainous country with fragile ecosystem, we are disproportionately affected by the impacts of climate change and global warming. We, therefore, support effective implementation of the Paris Agreement and call for enhanced level of climate finance and technology transfer for the adaptation and mitigation.
Nepal continues to champion the cause of LDCs, LLDCs, South-South and triangular cooperation in the UN and other international forums.  Solidarity and cooperation with LDCs, LLDCs and SIDS will continue to characterize our deliberations.
Promoting regional economic cooperation remains our priority. A year ago, Nepal successfully hosted fourth BIMSTEC summit in Kathmandu. As the Chair of SAARC we have been consistently putting our efforts to revive the stalled SAARC process. Nepal plays its due role in Asian Cooperation Dialogue (ACD) as its member and in Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) as a dialogue partner.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Before I conclude, let me state that our efforts have been to ensure that Nepal’s foreign policy serves its purpose to safeguard the vital areas of our national interest in the context of changing global and regional dynamics. We are also fully aware that fundamentals of our foreign policy remain consistent with the constitutional provisions and our practice remains coherent and credible. Recently, we hosted a National Dialogue on Foreign Policy with an objective of forging minimum common understanding on the critical foreign policy areas. We consider that such exercise should continue in the future as well.
With a view to promoting deliberations on contemporary issues of global importance, we are preparing to host Sagarmatha Dialogue in Nepal early next year. We hope Sagarmatha Dialogue to be a unique contribution of Nepal in the policy deliberations that will be an important forum to broaden our understanding of the major issues shaping the global and regional order in our time.
I thank you all for your attention.

Distinguished Participants
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Namaste and Good Morning to you All !
At the outset, I would like to thank South Asia Institute of Advanced Studies and Chinese Academy of Sciences for their cordial invitation to me to address the workshop on “the Belt and Road Initiative in Nepal: Opportunities and Challenges.”
The topic is timely and pertinent for our deliberation. The workshop is important as it brings together the scholars and experts from diverse fields. I would like to welcome the team of professors from the Institute of Geographical Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, for travelling all the way from China to Nepal to attend this program, and highly appreciate for conducting the research on the green BRI in the Himalayan Region. I hope their findings will be beneficial to all of us.
I believe such regular interactions, deliberations and exchange of views by experts help to have comprehensive understanding of a project of global scale like BRI.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
The Belt and Road Initiative is a visionary undertaking of President Xi Jinping launched in 2013. It is a significant milestone that aims at promoting comprehensive connectivity and cooperation among the countries and people in the region and beyond. More than 130 countries have signed the MoU and some others have expressed their willingness to join this landmark initiative. We do believe that it will have a paramount impacts in the development landscope of the region and beyond, in 21st century.
We are happy to witness the miraculous development in China in a relatively short span of time. It has been able to lift its people out of poverty within few decades; not long ago an agrarian economy and has now become the second largest economy in the world.
Connectivity in a comprehensive manner is at the core of the BRI. Five priority areas as set by the BRI are in one way or the other aim to enhance connectivity to build a community of shared interests that fosters development and prosperity.
The connectivity projects of the Initiative will help to support the development strategies of the countries along the Belt and Road in keeping with their national priorities, tap market potential in this region, promote investment and consumption, create demands and job opportunities, enhance people-to-people and cultural exchanges, and mutual learning among the peoples of the relevant countries. Since the multilateralism and collective efforts are facing some challenges, and the tendency towards self-centeredness and protectionism is emerging, initiative like BRI can play an instrumental role to develop collectivism and to protect the spirit of economic globalization with more substantive value addition.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Nepal has entered a new era of peace and stability with the promulgation of a new Constitution in 2015 and the successful holding of elections in all three tiers resulting into the formation of strong governments at all levels. You may all know that Nepal aspires to become a middle-income country by 2030 and graduate from LDC status at an early date. The single-minded pursuit of the government remains development and prosperity.
To achieve these goals, we require massive investment in infrastructure development. We also require huge investment of capital and modern technology as well as expertise in the related fields. We believe that Chinese assistance and collaboration through BRI can be significant in supporting our development needs in infrastructures.
Nepal has become a part of the BRI after it signed an MoU in 2017. We are committed to implementing the MoU of Cooperation under BRI to promote sustainable development consistent with our development needs. Efficient connectivity will unfold manifold opportunities in various fields including in trade, investment, manufacturing and tourism.
Nepal and China are committed to enhance connectivity encompassing vital components such as ports, roads, railways, aviation and communications within the framework of Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network. It is a matter of happiness that Joint Communique of the Leaders’ Roundtable of the 2nd Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation has included in its annex “Trans-Himalayan Multi-dimensional Connectivity Network, including Nepal-China cross-border railway”.
We believe that BRI can support countries like Nepal to grow and prosper at an accelerated speed. As a framework to spur investment and enhance connectivity, BRI can be instrumental in addressing development bottlenecks arising out of connectivity and mobilizing finances for development while ensuring win-win benefits. Being a lanlocked country, Nepal is paying atleast 20 percent additional cost to its production and transit-transport cycle. It is contributing (negatively) to shrink its competitiveness in global market. This fact speaks a volume about the critical importance of connectivity to Nepal.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
We have concluded some important agreements with China in recent years for enhancing multidimensional connectivity between the two countries. Recently concluded Protocol on implementing Transit Transport Agreement between the two countries provides Nepal access to the Chinese seaports and dryports. This is an important milestone towards Nepal’s transformation from a landlocked country to a land-linked country. I am happy to share with you that we have completed all necessary internal procedures to bring the protocol into effect. Also, we concluded another MoU for building cross-border transmission line with China last year. Trans-Himalayan Railway will be a game changer in our development journey. Our two countries have already signed an MoU on Cooperation in the Railway Project. Pre-feasibility study of this project has already been completed and now we are in the process of feasibilty study and preparation of detailed project report.
Recent development in the areas of tourism, aviation, trade, cultural exchanges and people to people contacts are encouraging. we should explore the ways to unleash the potentials on the area of economic cooperations in the days ahead.
Rt. Hon. President paid a state visit to China in April this year and addressed the Second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation held in Beijing. The visit provided us a good opportunity to share our views on the importance of Belt and Road Initiative in promoting connectivity and realizing the sustainable development goals for countries like ours. I would like to fondly recall the very indepth statement (s) made by President Xi, where he highlighted the core concepts of BRI, including sustainabilty and green development .
Green BRI is call of the day at a time when we are witnessing the adverse impact of climate change. Unsustainable patterns of production and consumption have accelerated environmental degradation. Countries like Nepal are bearing the brunt of climate change despite negligible emissions from our side. Women and underprivileged community have been its main victims. The only way forward is development of green economy. While striving for economic development, BRI can play an important role in transforming to clean-energy mode and low-carbon economy.
The proposed BRI projects should aim at utilizing the rich resources along the Himalayan range and improving the quality of lives of peoples in those areas, while carefully examinig the sensitivity, vulnarabilty and fragileness of the Himalayas. The facilities and infrastructures thus created should support conservation efforts and help overall development of that region in a sustainable manner.
Nepal wills to contribute the green economy. Endowed by huge hydro resources with more than 40,000 MWs comercially feasible generating capacity, Nepal has great potential in this regard. If we can utilize the potentials of solar, wind and other means of renewable energy alongwith the hydropower, our contribution will be paramount in the region. We want to collaborate with the neighboring countries and welcome more investment and technology transfer in this area.
To materealize the vision of BRI in general, and Trans-Himalayan connectivity infrastuctures in particular, indepth researchs are extremely important, in the areas of geography, goology, hydrology, environment, economics, cultures and many mores. In this regard, collaboration between the think tanks and research institutes like CAS and Nepali research institutes will be very meaningful.
I believe that the workshop will bring forward pragmatic ideas to be utilized to tap the opportunities offered by the BRI.
Once again, I would like to thank the organizers for bringing forth this important topic for deliberations among the experts from diverse sectors.
I wish the workshop a success.
Thank you all for your kind attention !

Statement by Hon. Foreign Minister on Nepal-India relations
Posted onJuly 18, 2019July 18, 2019 

Statement by Minister for Foreign Affairs Hon. Mr. Pradeep Kumar Gyawali on
“Nepal-India Relations: Development and Dynamics” at a Talk Programme
organized by Pushpalal Memorial Foundation
(18 July 2019, Hotel Summit, Lalitpur)
 
____________________________________________________________________
 
Chairman of Pushpalal Memorial Foundation and
Former Prime Minister Hon. Mr. Madhav Kumar Nepal,
Hon. Ministers and Members of Parliament,
Ambassador of India to Nepal
His Excellency Shri Manjeev Singh Puri,
Distinguished Participants,
Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
It is a great privilege and honour for me to speak on the theme of “Nepal-India Relations: Development and Dynamics”. I would like to express my sincere thanks to the Chairman of Pushpalal Memorial Foundation for organizing this talk programme and also providing me with this opportunity to share my views.
 Let me begin with the historical relationship between Nepal and India. We know the relationship between our two countries is time immemorial. History tells us that even before the modern nations of Nepal and India came into existence, small kingdoms and princely states existing in the present territories of Nepal and India had developed flourishing relationship, both at the level of the government and the people. The bilateral relationship continued to grow in the subsequent times, reaching the present stage. This active relationship in continuity speaks volumes of engagements, friendship and cooperation between our two countries.
The closeness of the relationship between Nepal and India is based on the robust foundation of geographical proximity, civilization and cultural bonds, friendship between the two peoples, and similar perceptions on many global and regional issues including shared values. Nepal and India are two independent and sovereign countries; they are immediate neighbours, sharing a long stretch of boundary; and they exist side by side and interact much more densely in every sphere of life. When we realize this fact, we become further closer. And, it also automatically demands from us more efforts to take the relationship to a new height.
Distinguished Participants,
It is with this spirit that the two countries have maintained friendly and cooperative relationship at the highest political level. High level visits at increased frequency have helped not only strengthen friendship but also fructify the relationship in areas of mutual interest. In this context, I would like to fondly recall the visits of both prime ministers and four round of talks last year, which have contributed significantly to further cementing the bilateral ties and to explore the new vistas of cooperation.The growth of the relationship has produced tangible outcomes in many sectors, such as trade, transit, investment, tourism, culture, education, development cooperation and so on. Besides, continuous dialogues, exchange of ideas, and agreements, including through dozens of bilateral mechanisms, have substantially contributed to add dynamism to the relationship.
It is a matter of satisfaction that Nepal-India relations have been growing in multi-dimensional ways, creating myriads of opportunities. However, this does not mean that the relations are bereft of problems and issues. They are there; and it is not unnatural for any friendly neighbouring countries with wide gamut of relations and dense interaction. What we need to do is to continue removing obstacles, resolving issues and moving forward towards extracting the benefits from enhanced bilateral cooperation.
And what gives us enormous satisfaction is that we have clear  vision, sufficient commitment and required capability in both sides to address those issues.
Another important aspect in our relationship is that we have to understand the sensitivities of each other. If there is a trust that sensitivities are well taken care of, it will help grow the relationship smoothly. We need to continue strengthening cooperation for controlling the cross-border criminal and unwanted activities, which harm both countries. Similarly, we must prevent unscrupulous elements from using the soil of one country against another. Furthermore, a practical solution is also to be worked out for reducing Nepal’s huge trade deficit with India, as the huge imbalance in trade shows a negative picture.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Given India’s huge population, big size of economy, industrial capacity and technological progress, it has remained a major source of investment, import items, tourist inflows, technological support, and development cooperation to Nepal. India is on of the biggest source of foreign investment in Nepal in terms of amount. Among the source countries of tourists coming to Nepal, India is on top of all. Likewise, in Nepal’s total imports and exports, India occupies a prominent position. On the part of Nepal too, investment, export of goods and tourists outflow into India are there, though in a smaller scale. These facts and figures vindicate the depth and dynamism of our relationship. Here, what we need to do is to create a win-win situation for both countries. We have to work out plans for ensuring it in a sustainable way.
The areas of cooperation in our two countries are so wide and all-encompassing that potentials exist in almost every sector. We are blessed with enormous natural resources; we have young and active population; our history, culture and civilization are rich. Additionally, people-to-people bonds are strong and dynamic. Interdependence and interconnectedness are intense. India’s economy has already taken momentum, securing a respectable position in the global economy. It is an opportunity for Nepal to take the benefit from this economic growth. In Nepal too, economic growth rates have started going up, which can benefit India as well.
On of the critical issue to collaborate with, is the issue of climate change. Since the challenges of climate change has scaled up in unprecedented points, probably we should have to use the term climate crisis or urgency rather. As both countries are linked with similar climate system, ecology and Himalayan ranges, problem we face are almost identical. We can even talk the daily weather forecasts nowadays, the potential floods in Terai and adjoining parts of Northern India alarms millions of people everyday. It is a issue, which warrants us to work collaboratively, with sensitivity and urgency
It is rare to have a highly favourable situation in both countries, which is available at present, as reflected in the stable governments enjoying the two-thirds majority in the parliaments, enormous faith of the peoples in the leaders, accelerating economic growth rates, clear visions for development and prosperity, and strong commitments for delivery of outcomes to the peoples. I see it as a golden opportunity for both Nepal and India. We must do everything possible to tap this opportunity.
On the one hand, we need to work on a new agenda for development and shared prosperity in the changed scenario; and, on the other hand, we have to complete the unfinished tasks, clearing ways for novel ventures. These twin tasks are to be performed simultaneously. Old treaties and agreements await review for making them appropriate in the present context. Completion of long-standing bilateral cooperation projects of great significance, such as Pancheswor and Hulaki Roads, require due priority. Similarly, resolution of the boundary issues and the permanent solution to the problems of inundation are other important works to be accomplished.
I am happy to share the facts that a number of flagship projects between Nepal and India have been carried out. Some of them have already been completed and some are in the phase of implementation. The petroleum pipeline project from Motihari to Amlekhgunj is almost ready for operation. The Integrated Check Post in Birgunj has already started functioning and the next one in Biratnagar is awaiting its operationalization. Likewise, some segments of Hulaki Roads have been completed. The process for Raxaul to Kathmandu Railway line has begun with preliminary survey. The works relating to Inland Waterways have also started. We are developing strong connectivity with India through railways and waterways. Cooperation in the field of agriculture is taking momentum. New air entry points have been finalized to pave the way to boost the Nepali aviation industry. I am sure it will phenomenally help enhance movement of goods and people with less cost and less time.
When we talk about our relations, we should also take into account global developments, as they do have implications on bilateral relations. The world today has seen unprecedented developments in geo-politics, geo-economics, technology, and inter-state relations. Nationalistic fervor, protectionist policies, apathy to multilateralism, and dissociation from global and regional compacts and commitments have unexpectedly changed the dynamics of cooperation among countries. In such a volatile situation, countries like ours have to forge strong cooperation in order to secure common interests from the international and regional engagements.
Distinguished Participants,
The Government of Nepal has dedicated its entire efforts towards realizing the national aspiration of “Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali”. To help contribute to this drive,  we count high the collaboration with India. We welcome increased amount of investment from India into Nepal in areas of our national priority, such as hydro-power, transport infrastructure, tourism, agriculture, ICT, mines and minerals, education, health, manufacturing, etc. These investments will benefit not only Nepal but also India. In the areas of trade, enhanced market access for Nepali products in India as well as trade facilitation are required for reducing the trade deficit of Nepal, making the trade beneficial for both countries. Similarly, as we are going to celebrate the year 2020 as the “Visit Nepal Year”, we expect more tourists from India to Nepal in 2020 and beyond. From Nepal’s side too, a lot of Nepali people visit India every year as tourists. This is one of the important areas of cooperation between our two countries. As before, I am confident that Nepal will continue receiving increased amount of development cooperation from India. While saying so, I would like to thank the Government of India for continuously extending development cooperation to Nepal in the past as well as increasing the amount of such cooperation to Nepal in the budget announced recently.
Ladies and Gentlemen
After the historical political change, Nepal now is perfectly poised for development and prosperity. It is based on the facts on the ground. First, the country has political stability with a government enjoying two-thirds majority in the parliament. Second, with a new constitution as well as new and revised laws, legal base has taken strong roots. Third, good governance and reform in public service have received adequate priority. Fourth, revenue mobilization and financial discipline has created conducive environment in the economic and financial sector. Fifth, the Government of Nepal has given a tempo to development works. Sixth, a lot of incentives and facilities for foreign investors, industrialists and businesspersons are available in the country. Seventh, necessary infrastructure and facilities are being expanded for foreign tourists for their comfortable and enjoyable stay. Finally, the Government of Nepal is committed to strengthen ties with its immediate neighbours and other friendly countries around the world. I am confident that such a propitious environment will serve as a bedrock for the growth of our relations, accruing great advantages to both countries.
To end, I would like to say that there is every room for the expansion and deepening of Nepal-India relations in the days ahead. Both countries are replete with potentials. There is also the will and determination to realize these potentials for their development. With mutual understanding and trust at all levels, we can continue reaping the benefits of our friendship and cooperation. I see a brighter side in Nepal-India relations. I wish it to remain brighter forever.
I thank you for your kind attention.

Keynote Address by Hon. Pradeep Kumar Gyawali, Minister for Foreign Affairs
at Nepal Promotion Programme for Honorary Consuls General/ Consuls of Nepal on 26 June 2019, Kathmandu
Honorary Consuls General and Consuls of Nepal,
Distinguished Participants,
Ladies and Gentlemen
Namaste and Good Morning!
It is indeed a great pleasure to address this first ever gathering of Honorary Consuls/Consuls of Nepal’s hosted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Let me thank you all for your valuable participation in this important Nepal Promotion programme.
We intend to showcase Nepal and its potential through your active participation and cooperation for the promotion of trade, tourism, foreign investment and foreign employment in the outside world. I am confident that the program will be informative, interactive and productive and will contribute to furthering Nepal’s national economic interests abroad.
Distinguished participants,
I am happy to share with you the recent developments in our country. With the promulgation of a democratic and inclusive constitution in 2015, Nepal has successfully completed the nationally-led and owned unique peace process. The new constitution embraces universally accepted democratic values, norms and principles. Competitive multi-party elections, respect for fundamental human rights, free press, independent and impartial judiciary, strong commitment to rule of law and good governance remain the salient features of our constitution. The constitution has institutionalized democratic gains of the people achieve through successive people’s movement and established a federal democratic republic as per the wish of the people of Nepal.
Through the elections held in 2017, federal governance structures in all three tiers (namely federal, provincial and local level) have been operationalized. Strongly mandated governments both at the federal level and in all seven provinces have been formed. Likewise, 753 local governments have been functional across the country. With these developments, the protracted political transition has come to an end.
Now the government’s single-minded focus is on development and prosperity. For this, we have embarked on a journey of socio-economic transformation. We have defined ‘Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali’ as our overarching national aspiration. We aspire to be a nation that is economically prosperous, institutionally sustained and socially inclusive.
To achieve this vision, we strive to attain high economic growth through the mobilization of both domestic and foreign investment, optimizing our export trade, promoting tourism and forging synergetic partnerships with private sectors and other stakeholders.
Earlier in March this year, we successfully organized Investment Summit to showcase Nepal’s enormous potentials as a promising investment destination in multiple sectors. During the Summit, 77 projects were presented and we received a number of investment proposals, from our immediate neighbors and other friendly nations, to advance these projects.
Distinguished participants,
Political stability has been achieved that ensures predictability, consistency, coherence and stability in policies.
Needless to emphasize, all political parties in Nepal have common voice on the agenda of development and prosperity.
The Government is fully committed to creating an investment-friendly environment not by words but by actions. In this context, we have undertaken a number of policy, legal, institutional and procedural reform measures. This will enable investment from domestic private sector and foreign investors.
The Constitution of Nepal has guaranteed property rights, and also has taken a clear State Policy to encourage foreign capital and technological investment.
Nepal has adopted liberal economic policy and welcomes foreign capital and technological investment in national priority sectors.
We have enacted two important legislations namely Foreign Investment and Technology Transfer Act (FITTA) and Public-Private Partnership and Investment Act to encourage investment.
The Public Private Partnership and Investment Act provides one stop service for any foreign investment of over Nepali Rupees 6 billion or a hydropower project over 200 MW capacity. The one stop service has come into operation. Similarly, FITTA ensures national treatment for any foreign investment and repatriation of return has been guaranteed.
We offer an attractive incentive package in terms of corporate taxation, import duties, and export facilitation. Tax rates are predictable and tax holidays are guaranteed by the law for those industries that meet the criteria.
Procedures for land acquisition, company registration, environmental assessment and infrastructure development have been simplified. Online registration and payment system have been put in place.
With an aim of promoting good governance and rule of law, the government is committed to implementing zero-tolerance policy on corruption.
An independent judiciary, capable of adjudicating industrial and investment related disputes on a fast-track basis, has been a mainstay of our legal system.
Distinguished participants,
Nepal is a land of ample opportunities for investors. We allow 100 percent investment in almost all sectors. The negative list is very short.
As we are rich in natural resource endowments and have huge demographic dividend, Nepal’s future for development is very bright. Let me highlight some of the major areas that have the potentials to transform the economic landscape of our country.
With its vast geographical and bio diversity-comprising the arable land just 80 meter above the sea level to the top of the world, Nepal offers immense potentials for investment in agriculture sectors.
More than 40,000 MW of hydropower is economically viable. However, a fraction has been realized so far.
The Power Trade Agreement with India, MoU on BIMSTEC Grid Interconnection and MoU on Power Trade between Nepal and Bangladesh serve as an important regulatory framework to encourage investment in hydropower projects.
Nepal is also a reservoir of mines and minerals such as iron, cement and precious stones. Investment in this sector is equally profitable.
An attractive tourist destination with world renowned heritage sites, most favoured trekking routes, fascinating wild lives and amazing scenic beauty, with hospitable and welcoming people, investment in tourism sectors guarantees high return from investment.
Distinguished participants,
Nepal is located between India and China, two of the fastest growing economies with more than 2.5 billion population. We enjoy excellent relations with both of our neighbours. Nepal has been enjoying trade preferences with neighbours. Therefore, investors in Nepal do have assured markets.
In addition to this, Nepal, as an LDC, enjoys duty-free and quota free market access in advanced economies including EU and the USA.
Investors will also be benefitted by the relatively competitive labour forces available in Nepal. We have about 57 percent of population representing the working age group. English-speaking human resources are easily available in Nepal.
We have signed Bilateral Investment Promotion and Protection Agreements as well as Avoidance of Double Taxation Agreements with a number of countries.
Despite of our best efforts, FDI flow in Nepal remains minimal. Under such circumstances, we need to execute robust economic diplomacy, soliciting potential investors that investment in Nepal is profitable with win-win opportunities for both investors and Nepal.
Distinguished participants,
I would like to underline that huge investment is need of the day. It is a top priority of the Government. In this situation, we have an important responsibility of branding Nepal’s image abroad as promising destination for investment. Effective economic diplomacy is the call of the day.
Missions and Consulates General should regularly organize promotional activities on trade, investment, culture and tourism and advocate for Nepal’s interest in the countries they are accredited to.
We need to convince investors that political climate is supportive. Regulatory framework is sound. Policy, legal and institutional framework is enabling and encouraging. Regional ambience is equally promising.
We are celebrating the year 2020 as Visit Nepal Year with a goal to attract more than 2 million tourists. We need to publicize Nepal’s tourism potentials in respective countries to meet our goal.
We need to establish good network with local business community, NRNS, business chambers, tourism and donor agencies and disseminate information on economic issues through them.
Regular contact with media and expanding network with businesses and investors is also essential to publicize Nepal’s positive image abroad. Local journalists can be encouraged to travel to Nepal and write promotional blogs in local media.
Our collective efforts for socio-economic prosperity and progress of Nepal will deliver desired outcome.
I am confident that discussion and interaction today and tomorrow will enhance understanding, clear confusions, if any, and encourage us to move with full confidence to contribute to our goal of development and prosperity.
I thank you for your kind attention and wish you a pleasant stay.

Statement by the Honourable Mr. Gokarna Raj Bista, Minister for Labor, Employment and Social Security of Nepal at the Plenary of the 108th Session of the International Labour Conference,
Palais des Nations, Assembly Hall, Geneva
13 June 2019
President of the Conference,
Excellencies,
Director General of the ILO,
Distinguished Delegates,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is my honor to address this Centenary session of the International Labour Conference.
The Centenary celebration is an opportune time to reflect on the key role played by ILO in promoting peace, equality and social justice. On this occasion, speaking at the High-Level Section of the ILO Centenary Conference on June 10th, our Right Honourable Prime Minister underlined among others the significant contribution of ILO in promoting fundamental principles and rights at work, social protection, tripartism and social dialogue.
Let me commend the excellent contribution of the High-Level Commission in preparing the human-centered report on ‘Work for a brighter future’ and the Director General’s coordination to put it into action.
Mr. President, 
Decent work, social security and harmonious industrial relations have taken the center stage in Nepal’s reform agenda. We have initiated multiple policy and legal reforms in the field of labour, employment and social security.
We have introduced a labour audit system that enables enterprises to enhance the compliance of labour laws. Our efforts are ongoing in the implementation of these reforms in collaboration with the social partners.
The Government of Nepal has launched the Prime Minister Employment Program to create decent job opportunities and ensure work-based social protection to every citizen. Our efforts are also directed to promote dignity and worth of labour at the grass-root level. With a view to improve productivity and living standards of workers, policy measures have been put in place to ensure minimum wages in a timely manner.
Mr. President, 
We are committed to fight against potential violence and harassment in the world of work. We are implementing a master plan to eliminate all forms of child labour by 2025. Having joined the Alliance 8.7 as a pathfinder country, Nepal is also committed to end all forms of child labour, forced labour, human trafficking and modern forms of slavery.
Our efforts in labour migration reforms are in line with the spirit of the Global Compact on migration. We believe that cooperation and partnership is the key to safe, orderly and regular migration. Migrant workers deserve equality of treatment in destination countries. Nepal is actively promoting these concepts through the Colombo Process, of which we are the current Chair.
Mr. President, 
I would like to commend the ILO for its continuous cooperation and support to promote decent and productive work and implement labour reforms in Nepal. This is important for the promotion of productive and decent work opportunities, universal social security and shaping the future of work in Nepal.
Finally, I am confident, the unique tripartite constituents of ILO would be able to forge a better future for the rapidly evolving world of work and set another milestone in ILO’s glorious history.
Thank you.

Address to the Oxford Union by Prime Minister of Nepal Right Honourable Mr. K P Sharma Oli on ‘Peace, Democracy and Development’
London, United Kingdom, 10 June 2019
Thank you for your kind words of introduction.
Mr. President
Distinguished Guests, and
Ladies and Gentlemen
Thank you, Mr. President, for the kind invitation to speak at this debating society.
It is indeed a rare and distinct honour to speak from this podium to such an august gathering.
It is a special privilege to join the many renowned and influential world figures that this hall has hosted over the years, and extend my best wishes to you all.
Known as it is for the distinguished service to humanity through generation and dissemination of knowledge; contribution the Oxford University has made over the centuries to the world of education is matchless.
Oxford is much more than a physical place for teaching and learning. It is an epitome of human pursuit of knowledge right from the medieval times. It is a center of knowledge and research where learning is nobler and superior.
I equally admire the contributions of the Oxford Union to generation of knowledge by promoting free exchange of ideas and debate.
As a person who spent over five decades of his life in struggles for democratic rights and faced severe punishment of fourteen long years of imprisonment including four years of solitary confinement, I know how important the access to education and freedom of speech are for people and society to grow, develop and prosper.
Today, I will talk about the broader topic of ‘Peace, Democracy and Development’. Speaking on a theme in the land that developed ‘Magna Carta’, the first charter of human rights and fundamental freedoms and the mother of all such instruments, is equally pleasing.
First, I will dwell on the general linkages between peace, democracy and development in the context of current world realities. Then, I will share with you some insights into Nepal’s journey of political struggles, and quest for democracy and development.
Ladies and Gentlemen
The world today is characterized by both optimism and anguish; by achievements and setbacks; and by prospects and problems.
Notwithstanding the prosperity the world has achieved, it is not yet entirely free from poverty, inequality, conflict, climate change, and terrorism, among others.
Amidst these challenges, the tendencies of populism, protectionism and inward-looking thinking have become more pronounced.
Growing tussle between and among the world’s largest economies has raised doubt over the future of multilateral trading system and overshadowed the prospect for global development.
The fourth industrial revolution along with ‘disruptive technologies’ has led the world towards greater prosperity. However, its benefits are not judiciously shared. Inequality persists. The existence of poverty is against the values of human civilization and our conscience.
This is where lie the roots of the problems. And, no one is spared from these problems as they transcend boundaries and borders of a society, nation and region.
Dear Friends,
Peace, democracy and development are intrinsically link to each other. Democracy and development are contingent upon peace and peace cannot be achieved and sustained in the absence of development. And, it is only the democratic system that paves the way for lasting peace and development.
Understanding the complex relationship between peace, democracy and development would warrant an in-depth knowledge of root causes of conflict.
Peace is much more than the absence of war. It is an idea, a condition, a culture and a way of society and nation.
As an idea, it is a vision aimed at greater good of society. Values such as harmony, tolerance, coexistence and unity are essential catalysts for peace.
As a condition, it is the desired state of political, social and economic realities. It is about enjoyment of all rights by individuals without any discrimination and securing equal access to economic resources.
As a culture and a way of society and nation, peace must be understood in casual relationship with democracy and development. Peaceful environment enables societies and nations to achieve progress and prosperity.
Like creativity and innovation, the roots of conflict and violence are also inherent in human minds. These roots are nurtured by ignorance, greed and intolerance. So, the foundation of peace must be built in human minds themselves.
As a staunch fighter for democracy throughout my life, I believe the alternative to democracy is ‘more democracy’.
This corresponds to the ‘Comprehensive democracy’. It embraces democratic rights including at the political, economic, social, cultural and technological levels to empower people.
At the political level, what we need is a fine balance between freedom and responsibility. Democracy is about civic rights. It is also about civilized way of behaviour.
At the economic level, it is about empowering people with means, resources and choices. It is about ending poverty, inequality and backwardness.
At the social and cultural levels, democracy must address the problems related to power dynamics and promote a sense of belongingness, inclusivity and justice.
At the technological level, new means of disruptive technologies must be used for the sake of empowering people. After all, it was not technologies that created democracy; it was democracy that created technologies.
Let me also touch upon the need of comprehensive democracy at the international level.
No matter what the name suggests, the world order is far from being representative. Democratic deficit characterizes the world order.
On economic front too, systemic inequality still persists. Though globalization has not benefitted all equally, its very foundation is being challenged by its own proponents.
Comprehensive democracy demands a world order that is democratic, inclusive, just, fair and seeks a balance between enjoyment of rights and fulfillment of obligations in good faith. Its foundation is the principle of sovereign equality.
And, democracies cannot sustain within the borders of nations, if the broader global ecosystem is undemocratic.
The realization of SDGs by all will help translate the vision of comprehensive democracy into practice. For me, the notion of comprehensive democracy finds its eloquent expression in the SDGs’ underlying philosophy of ‘leaving no one behind’.
There are certain universally accepted democratic values and norms that all must adhere to. In essence, democracy must embrace equal rights, equal opportunities, equal protection of security and equal respect as its key pillars. This is the core of comprehensive democracy.
We confront the most difficult task ahead: how to ensure the security of mankind and the planet and hand over the habitable planet to future generations. The growing phenomenon of climate change poses a serious existential threat to humanity. It jeopardizes the health of both mankind and planet. So, we must rise above the parochial national interest to galvanize our efforts for the survival of humanity.
It is unfortunate that the countries like Nepal which emit negligibly and contribute substantially to the maintenance of global ecological order are ironically bearing the brunt of disproportionate impact of climate change. This is simply unacceptable.
Our Himalayas and forests contribute to the recharging system of the earth and also keep the environment clean and cool. This is an extraordinary contribution. This must be recognized and climate justice should be upheld as an essential component of comprehensive democracy at the global level.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Since I am talking about peace, democracy and development, I wish to speak about how Nepal attained the present state of peace and stability with particular focus on our peace process.
Our journey to peace and political stability has been full of struggles, movements and sacrifices. Some of them have been truly transformative of historic proportions.
Major milestones were the political transformations of 1951, 1990 and 2006.
The autocratic Rana Regime that perpetuated the family rule was overthrown on the strength of people’s movement in 1951.
This paved the democratic journey of Nepal.
The absolute monarchy was brought to the constitutional fold through a sustained political movement in 1990.
This established constitutional supremacy and restricted the King’s power as constitutional head of the state.
The institution of hereditary monarchy, based on the principle of ‘supremacy by birth’, was finally abolished, two years after the successful People’s Movement in 2006.
In the intervening period, we witnessed a decade-long armed conflict that began in 1996 with a huge cost upon the peace-loving Nepali people.
However, its contribution to Nepal’s political movement for establishing people’s sovereignty and rights has been significant.
Our peace process began with the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Accord in 2006 that formally ended the armed conflict.
The period between 2008 and 2015 was marked by intense debate, consultations, accommodation and compromises on the nature, scope and contents of the new constitution. This was essential to address multiple problems that Nepali society faced due to its diverse nature.
After years of hard work the constitution was promulgated by an inclusive Constituent Assembly in September 2015.
We accomplished this historic responsibility in a peaceful way, keeping the vital national interest uppermost.
In all these transformative developments and movements the Nepal Communist Party played a decisive role.
The promulgation of the Constitution marked the conclusion of peace process and institutionalized the democratic gains made by the people.
Political pluralism, periodic elections, inclusion and proportional representation, fundamental freedoms and human rights, rule of law, independent judiciary, separation of powers and checks and balances, and people’s sovereignty are the major features of our Constitution.
The Constitution guarantees 33 percent representation of women in the Federal Parliament and Provincial Assemblies and 40 percent at the Local Level. Today, their overall representation in the elected bodies has reached 41 percent. Minorities and disadvantaged communities are also guaranteed their proportional representation.
The historic elections held in 2017 have produced a strong and stable government with a robust mandate to Nepal Communist Party.
This has effectively ended the cycle of political uncertainty and frequent change of governments.
With federal system in place, 753 Local, 7 Provincial and 1 Federal Government are functional.
Nepal has ushered in an era of peace, stability and prosperity. Democracy has been consolidated and it has reached the grassroots level.
Nepal’s experience with peace-making and peace-building has been an eminently endogenous process, with many salient features that are unique to our special circumstances. It could present a unique case study of conflict resolution and peace building.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
With political issues settled, our fight is now directed against poverty, underdevelopment, inequality, illiteracy and backwardness.
Our vision is guided by the long-term aspiration of ‘Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali’. Prosperity alone cannot ensure happiness, as it is contingent upon a wide range of material and spiritual factors. So we aim to achieve both prosperity and happiness for lasting peace and stability.
We want to become a middle-income country as well as realize the SDGs by 2030. We have crafted a long-term vision for development and periodic plans to guide our economic journey.
Social justice remains at the core of our polity. Unity in diversity is our strength. We have established the foundation of a non-discriminatory, inclusive and participatory democracy to bring everyone onboard for socio-economic transformation. Our demographic dividend and huge national resources offer enormous possibilities for development.
Our model of development aims at ensuring basic services such as food security, shelter and clothing, education, and health and security for all. Our priority is not only about building and sustaining a political system but also about achieving overall social transformation. Sarwajan Hitaya Sarwajan Sukhaya (welfare and happiness for all) is at the heart of our efforts.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Today’s world has witnessed the popular disappointment with democracy. It seems that democracy has been facing a crisis of confidence.
It may be because democracy has failed to promote equality, justice, employment, freedom, and deliver tangible outcomes to bring about the changes in the living standards of people. Democracy has tended at times to become a formality and rhetoric, not substantive and people-centered.
But, the question is- whether it is the problem of the very essence of democracy as such or the dilemma has been created by ourselves, through our commissions or through our omissions?
The understanding of democracy has often been limited, with an outlook emanating from the binary boxes.
Unfortunately, democracy has been compartmentalized in the pigeonholes.
Look around. The challengers of democracy today are in the both sides of political spectrum. The assaults are coming from the extremist elements in the Left as well as the Right. The dichotomy of the Left and the Right fails to work here.
Prescriptive approach developed on the basis of binary opposites, which is not mindful of the local context, does no justice to democracy itself.
We must admit that there is no single formula of democracy and no fixed model of development.
The political system of a particular country may inherit its historical background and socio-cultural features, thus making the system unique. We should accept and respect the local reality.
In Nepal’s context, the democratic values and pluralism are inherent in our own culture and they are born out of our own conscience and conviction. We have been practicing them as Nepali way of life.
All democratic efforts must keep people at the centre. Democracy must serve them, and make them happy. Democracy must help common people explore and develop their own potentials.
Democratic government must be responsible and accountable to the people. It should be transparent as well. The most important task of the democratic government is to ensure the basic rights of the people so that ‘no one is left hungry and no one dies of hunger’. Right to life is the most important of all human rights.
Furthermore, people themselves are the custodians of peace. They are the defenders of democracy and champions of human rights. Therefore, democracy and its ‘bidirectional’ outcomes- peace and development- must aim at serving the people.
Also, it is the people who must lead the opinions in democracy. People must not be misled. Leaders must listen to them. They should refrain themselves from catering to the populist impulse of the electorate.
The defense of democracy should indeed be built in the minds of people –in their values, in their way of life.
Culture of enlightened discourse rather than an irresponsible anarchy of mob are the ultimate guard of democracy.
To conclude, peace and democracy are never the ‘things’ done. They are always in the process of ‘becoming’. We must believe in them and work at them. Such work may be gradual and quiet but it should be sustainable. And, sustainable efforts are those, which take into account the local realities, and keep people at the centre with a view to empowering them.
I thank you all for this wonderful opportunity.

Posted onJune 10, 2019June 10, 2019 


Statement by the Rt. Honourable Mr. K P Sharma Oli, Prime Minister of Nepal, at the 108th Session (Centenary) of the International Labour Conference
Geneva, 10 June 2019
President of the Centenary International Labour Conference,
Excellencies Heads of State and Government,
Director General of ILO Mr. Guy Ryder,
Employers’ and Workers’Representatives,
Ladies and Gentlemen.
We are gathered here today at a historic occasion

to mark the centenary of an organization that pioneered in writing the most ambitious social contract in the history of humankind,
to mark the centenary of the vision and aspiration for a just, humane and equitable world, and
to lay an equally enduring foundation for the future.

This centenary celebration of the International Labour Organization is a celebration of the rights of the toiling masses to social justice through social dialogue.
I extend warm congratulations to ILO fraternity on this historic occasion.
I feel deeply honoured to be part of this momentousoccasion and thank the Director General for the invitation.
I have brought greetings and best wishes from the land of Sagarmatha- the Mount Everest, and Lumbini, the birthplace of Buddha and the fountain of Buddhism, for the success of this Conference.
Excellencies,
The ILO’s Constitution was framed in the ashes of the First World War. Itreflected the collective desire and commitment of humanity to peace through social dialogue.
It was a testimony that production relations can be transformed through dialogue.
The core principles that ILO advanced, such as equal pay for equal value of work, freedom of association, working hours, adequate wage for living, balance between work and life, and social protection are its unique contributions to human civilization.
These are not ordinary achievements. ILO is a trendsetter of the future.
I would like to mention here two landmark initiatives of the last decade of the twentieth century- Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work in 1998 and the Decent Work Agenda in 1999.
The report “Work for a Brighter Future” of the Global Commission on the Future of Work provides a sound basis for our deliberation.
I believe the report will set a discourse for another quarter of a century.
Development of technology, shifting demography, migration and change in the organization of work are creating new paths to prosperity.
On the other hand, they are disrupting the existing work arrangements.
Technology has replaced traditional jobs, transformed the way we work, and created more innovative workplaces.
Artificial intelligence, automation, robotics, internet, 3D printing and block-chain are bringing profound changes in the way we imagine the work.
The gig economy is providing millions an alternative to work remotely.
However, every change comes with new opportunities and challenges. This provides an opportunity to define that our destiny remains at the human command, but not at the command of technology,

an opportunity that we handover a liveable planet to our posterity, and
an opportunity to create a win-win situation through demographic dividend to supplement where human capital is in short supply.In managing the changes, we must keep human at the centre of all.

Investing in people’s capabilities, promoting entrepreneurship and creating decent jobs are critical to cope with the changes.
We must ensure gender equality, strengthen social protection, respect social dialogue, and guarantee rights at work.
As the climate change is raising demands in green jobs, climate actions will be most effective if they begin at the world of work.
Green jobs would be the stepping-stones towards green economy.
Adequate wages and time sovereignty go hand in hand. That is the sign of prosperity and wellbeing of all workers.
Labour is not a commodity. ILO has a role to play that core principles of Philadelphia Declaration areupheld at all times.
Persistent unemployment of youth breeds political instability and engenders poverty.
We must end this situation.
Excellencies,
Nepal is endowed with vast natural resources as well as rich demographic dividend. This makes future of the world of work in Nepal highly promising.
We have adopted firm legal and policy reforms to address the dynamic international labour environment.
We have domesticated the provisions of the fundamental ILO instruments to which we are a party.
Our laws do not discriminate workers on the basis of their status – regular or irregular, outsourced or contractual and those coming from organized or informal sector.
We redefined the notion of life-long job by social protection to all workers irrespective of their nature of job; ensured fair balance between flexibility and social security; and legally ended the dichotomy of formal vs. informal sector.
This way, we have successfully concluded the process of formalizing the informal sector.
Excellencies,
Nepal’s democratic Constitution is founded on the ideals of equality, non-discrimination, and social justice.
Democracy without economic right and social justice remains incomplete.
Our conception of democracy goes beyond the formalities such as formation of political party, participation in electoral process or enjoyment of the freedom of expressions.
Ours is a comprehensive democracy that empowers individual in all dimensions- political, economic, social and cultural.
Our Constitution embodies social justice, right against exploitation, rights to work, remuneration and social security as well as right to trade union and collective bargaining.
The rights to education, health care, food, housing, culture and language are guaranteed as fundamental rights of our people.
We have enacted a number of implementing legislations to enforce the fundamental rights, including those related to the world of work.
The entire life of an individual is covered by social security system. In childhood and old age, the State provides universal social security. In active age, workers are protected through contribution-based social security. This provision has been incorporated in the Social Security Act.
Last year in November, we launched a comprehensive social security scheme to the working people.
This largest ever social security undertaking in Nepal is being implemented through contribution from both the workers and employers, and covers benefits such as unemployment, maternity, sickness, old age, accident, dependent family members, and disability.
For past 25 years, Nepal has been providing old age pension to the senior citizens, and monthly allowances to single women and those coming from the most marginalized section of our society.
There has been gradual increment in the amount and coverage of this critical cash hand-out.
This year in February, we launched yet another employment based social security scheme under the Prime Minister Employment Program.
This flagship program aims to create jobs, guarantees employment to every working age citizen, provides allowances in case of unemployment, promotes innovation and entrepreneurship, and supports skilling, re-skilling and up-skilling.
To change the production relations, we have introduced new sets of labour laws that safeguard dignity of work, guarantee equal pay for the equal value of work, and ensure flexibility in the world of work.
The Trade Union Act protects collective rights of our workers in line with ILO Conventions 87 and 98.
Excellencies,
Inclusion remains a basic tenet of our polity.
Special measures are in place to ensure inclusion of all sections of our society in the State organs.
One-third representation of women is guaranteed in the Federal Parliament and Provincial Assemblies.
Elections in 2017 have resulted over 41 per cent of women’s representation in elected bodies.

Excellencies,
Enterprises are the drivers of modern economy that provide jobs and implement ILO standards. Our actions should support them to grow, create more jobs, and sustain economy. By jobs we mean the development of entrepreneurship, enterprises, MSMEs, start-upsand self-employment.
Decent jobs for our youths and social security to all are a key to address the job deficit.
Migrant workers are often vulnerable to high recruitment costs, contract substitution, unsafe and unsecured working conditions, and non-compliance of terms of employment.
Nepal being a country of origin as well as destination, we consider that the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration (GCM) adopted in December last year provides a framework for cooperation.
Our role in the ILO Governing Body and UN Human Rights Council is informed by the basic premises of GCM to make labour migration safe, orderly and beneficial to all.
Dear brothers and sisters,
We have created institutional framework for social dialogue at the federal, provincial, local and enterprise levels.
Through a common platform of Joint Trade Union Coordination Centre, Nepal practices a unique example of unity in diversity of trade unions.
This distinct forum of workers represents all working people in Nepal to engage in social dialogue and promotes their interest in a spirit of solidarity and harmonious labour relations.
Presence of tripartite forum at the centre has resulted in improved labour relations that have brought down the labour disputes almost to nought.
The Government ensures employer’scompliance throughlabour audit that provides an opportunity for reflection, self-assessment and improvement.
Labour inspection and inspection of occupational safety and health are the integral part of labour audit.
The world of work in Nepal has voluntarily evolved a social contract to implement rights related issue and engage in collective agreements to safeguard the interests.
Excellencies,
Nepal’s own democratic struggles drew significant inspiration from the work of ILO as many of our trade union leaders were the torchbearers of resistance against autocracy and pioneer of the democratic movements.
Over five decades of my public life, I have fought for equality and social justice for our people.
The Government under my leadership is focused on realizing the national aspiration of ‘Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali’.
For prosperity, we need skilled labour.This helps foster prosperity, which should lead to happiness. In this context, we want to define it as- सक्षम श्रमिक, समृद्ध नेपाल, सुखी नेपाली – meaning ‘skilled workers, prosperous Nepal, happy Nepali’to underpin our agenda for decent work, wage and workplace.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
We intend to end all forms of deprivation and exploitation, ensure equitable development and establish a socialism-oriented state as envisioned by our Constitution.
We aim to end the worst form of child labour by 2022 and all forms of child labour by 2025.
We are committed to meeting SDGs before 2030, including the SDG 8 composite in all its dimensions.
With this objective in mind, Nepal joined the Alliance 8.7 as a Pathfinder country.
To conclude, Mr. President, hundred years on, the preambular words of the ILO’s Constitution continue to resonate in this assembly hall calling for reaffirmation to social justice and lasting peace.
We must meet these ‘moral-minimum’ and move forward to address more pressing issues of our time.
Today is the time to uphold ILO’s founding ideals and demonstrate that they continue to be relevant in furthering the value of human worth, equality, social justice and sustainable future.
Let us deliberate on how ILO can secure its own future and the future of its tripartite constituents.
I am confident, the outcome document of this Centenary event adequately reflects on that important aspect of the organization.
I thank you all.

Remarks by Minister for Foreign Affairs Hon. Mr. Pradeep Kumar Gyawali
at the ‘International Forum on Mountain Tourism’ and
Launching Ceremony of ‘International Mountain Tourism Day’
Kathmandu, 29 May 2019
Mr. Chairperson
Mr Fu Yingchun,  Executive Secretary General
of International Mountain Tourism Alliance
Mr Deepak Raj Joshi, CEO Nepal Tourism Board
Mr CN Pandey, Chairman Nepal Association of Tour and Travel
 Agents Mr Yang Shichao, CDA of Embassy of China Excellencies,
Distinguished delegates
Entrepreneurs, and
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Namaste and a very Good Morning!
First of all, I would like to thank the organizers for inviting me to participate and speak a few words in this ‘International Forum on Mountain Tourism, Nepal’. I am also pleased to learn about the launching of ‘International Mountain Tourism Day’ today.
I extend my congratulations and best wishes on the occasion of Sagarmatha day.
On behalf of the Government of Nepal, I would also like to welcome all delegates to this programme. In particular, special welcome to the international delegates from our friendly countries!
I thank you for travelling all the way to Nepal and wish you a very pleasant and fruitful stay here.
In fact, it is really heartening to learn that this event has brought together experts and tourism entrepreneurs from more than 30 countries. I appreciate the initiative and thoughtful decision of the organizers to host this event on mountain tourism.
I am much hopeful that this broader network stands fruitful in sharing of experiences and expertise, and learning from each-other in the field of mountain tourism.
Dear Friends,
When asked about his feat of reaching the summit of Mt. Everest on this day back in 1953, Sir Edmund Hillary said, ‘It is not the mountain we conquer; but ourselves’. If we go by what he said, we have come a long way in ‘conquering ourselves’ over the last sixty-six years.
That historic landmark achieved by Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay Sherpa left to us not just an event in the history of mountaineering and adventure tourism but also a way of realizing our potential and understanding our relationship with nature.
Climbing mountains is a process, not an event. Mountaineering in particular and other forms of tourism in general are therefore a process of befriending nature by human beings.
In Nepal, which has eight out of ten tallest mountains on earth, mountains, of course, constitute a fascinating destination for adventure tourism with their majestic beauty and pristine nature.
The history of mountaineering tourism in Nepal dates back to 1950s. Since then, Nepal has always been a life time attraction for mountaineers. Thousands of Nepali nationals and foreigners have already reached the summits of various mountains.
This is a happy story that we all cherish. We are effortful to retain the primacy of our mountains as the centre of global attraction for adventure tourism.
However, the vignettes of man’s scaling up of mountains do not suffice to describe their splendour and beauty.
Mountains are neither fair nor unfair, neither good nor bad, neither friendly nor dangerous. There are ‘just there’ for us to admire and ponder on.
For us in Nepal, mountains are our identity markers and promoters of our image at the international arena. And for everyone interested to know about them, they are most powerful, ‘most awe-inspiring and most unconquerable’. Mountains are the places where legends live and where everything is bigger than life.
Dear Friends,
Today, we all are concerned about the growing consequences of climate change upon these ‘wonderful gifts’ of nature. It is not simply because of their value in the eco-system but also because of their importance as a source of livelihood and survival for millions of people living downstream.
In the last five decades, rise in global temperatures and a fall in the amount of precipitation in the mountain region have led to mountain glaciers shrinking by over 30 percent. This comes as a strong reminder that mountains are not at all immune to the climate assault.
In this context, a major challenge before us is to implement our resolve to preserve mountain ecology in the larger interest of mankind. It is imperative therefore that we all take concrete actions before it is too late.
It is not least in realization of this fact that mountains and issues concerning their promotion and conservation have received priority in the policies and programmes of the Government of Nepal.
The new policies and programmes of the Government of Nepal for 2019/20, for example, emphasize the promotion of tourism sector with proper utilization and conservation of topographical diversity including mountains.
This is in line with the SDG goal number 15.4 that relates the need for conservation of mountain ecosystems, including their biodiversity, for sustainable development.
Dear Friends,
Given the country’s topography and landscape, Nepal has abundant prospects for touristic activities such as mountaineering, trekking and travel, among others. In addition to the mountains, the ever flowing Himalayan rivers, glaciers, large lakes, green valleys, beautiful waterfalls and the national parks are the major attractions for tourists visiting Nepal.
Tourism has been an important sector of Nepal’s economy. It, like in any other developing country, has been playing a very significant role in poverty reduction. It has also contributed to employment and income generation with its linkages to different sectors of the economy.
We remain effortful in attracting more quality tourists to Nepal. Visit Nepal Campaign 2020, which will be run with a goal of bringing in two million tourists, is one such effort. Of course, mountain tourism will be, as always, a major priority in our Campaign.
To conclude, I am confident that the deliberations in this programme will add value to our continued efforts towards promoting sustainable mountain tourism. I am equally confident that it will help enhance our understanding of mountains and our relations to them.
I wish this International Forum all success!
I thank you all for your kind attention.

Statement by Hon. Mr. Pradeep Kumar Gyawali, Minister for Foreign Affairs, at the Workshop on
“Enforced Disappearance in Asia: Prevailing Laws, Challenges and Solutions”
Kathmandu, 27 May 2019
 
Chair of the Workshop and chairperson of the INSEC Dr Indira Shreshtha,
Vice Chair of the UN committee on Enforced Disappearances Rainer Huhle,
UN Residential Coordinator HE Valerie Julliand,
Pioneers of the Human Right Movement,
Participants and guests from the Asian Region, Ladies and Gentlemen,
I begin by thanking the organizers- Informal Sector Service Centre and Advocacy Forum- for inviting me to be part of this session of the workshop. I would like to welcome all the foreign delegates and wish your please to stay in Kathmandu.
The issue you have chosen to deliberate during these two days is important to all of us, particularly the countries that have emerged from varieties of internal upheavals or conflicts.
I am confident that this exercise would be useful to learn from each other’s experiences and strive for the betterment.
Dear Friends,
Nepal’s democracy is an outcome of long struggles to secure fundamental freedom, human rights and justice to all of our citizens.
The Government elected by overwhelming popular mandate and led by the leaders who sacrificed everything for the establishment of rights and freedom to the people, remained in prison for many years, or suffered human rights violations, is resolutely committed to the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedom of our people.
For this reason, Nepal has made strong constitutional and legal safeguards against all human rights violations, including the act of enforced disappearances and ensured adequate judicial remedies in case of violations.
The Constitution of Nepal guarantees right to freedom to every citizen and protects people’s personal life and liberty.
The Constitution provides that no person can be taken into custody without informing the ground for such arrest. Arrested person’s right to be produced before the court within 24 hours and the right to consult with a lawyer is protected as the fundamental right.
The Constitution is explicit that unless there exists sufficient ground of imminent threat to the sovereignty, territorial integrity or public peace and order of the country, no person can be held under preventive detention. Existence of such a situation is determined by the court of law not by law enforcement authorities.
Information about the situation of a person who is held under preventive detention is required to be communicated immediately to his or her family members or relatives. Any person subjected to preventive detention in bad faith is entitled to claim compensation from the State.
Right against physical or mental torture or cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment is guaranteed with adequate judicial remedies in case of infringement of such right. The person or authority involved in such treatment is punishable by law.
To comply with the order of the Supreme Court (2007) and to make necessary legal protection against the act of enforced disappearance, the penal code of Nepal has criminalized such act and provided legal remedies to the victim.
Nepal is a State party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention against Torture, Cruel or Inhuman Treatment or Punishment. We have adhered to the provisions of those instruments in good faith. Our commitment to human rights is total.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Nepal transitioned through a stage of internal conflict. As per the spirit of the Comprehensive Peace Accord (CPA) signed between the Government and the then rebel party in November 2006, one of the important task of the peace process was to find the truth, make the perpetrators of serious violations of human rights accountable and provide reparation to the victims.
With the view to implement the CPA and in line with the provision of the Interim Constitution and the order of the Supreme Court, Nepal in 2015 established two separate commissions- the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission on the Investigation of Enforced Disappeared Persons (CIEDP) to deal with the conflict era human rights violations.
The mandate of the Commissions is based on the principles of truth-seeking, inquiry, accountability, reconciliation, reparations and measures of non-repetition.
The CIEDP has collected over 3 thousand complaints and commenced preliminary investigation of over 2 thousand and 2 hundred cases. The Mandate of the CIDEP has been extended up until February 2020 and the Government is in the process of appointing members of the commission to complete the remaining tasks.
For this purpose, necessary amendment to the Act was done recently to initiate an independent process of selecting the candidates to serve in the Commissions.
As required by the TRC Act, the Government of Nepal has constituted an independent five member recommendation committee headed by former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.
The Committee is mandated by law to recommend most qualified persons to serve in the two transitional justice commissions. The Committee has begun its work and is expected to complete it in due course of time. Upon appointment of the members of the Commissions,
At the same time, to address the concerns raised on the TRC Act, the Government is preparing to submit amendment to the Act in the current session of the Federal Parliament. A broad based consultation was conducted in an open, inclusive and transparent manner. The comments, feedbacks and suggestions received are being examined to further enrich the content of the amendment Bill.
The Government of Nepal reiterates that the perpetrators of serious violations of human rights will not go unpunished.
We have reaffirmed in every appropriate occasion that transitional justice process will be guided by the Comprehensive Peace Accord, directive of the Supreme Court, relevant international commitments, concerns of the victims and the ground realities. Independence of the Commissions will be guaranteed and adequate resources including budgetary, human and technical will be ensured by the Government of Nepal.
Nepal successfully traversed through an arduous journey of peace process with strong resolve and commitment of Nepali political leadership, unwavering support of Nepali people, and the continuous good will and understanding of the international community, including the United Nations.
Despite the pains and losses of the past internal conflict, the nationally led peace process that followed was able to bring fundamental democratic transformation in political, social and human rights realm of the country.
Those achievements have now been firmly institutionalized in the Constitution of Nepal. Sustaining peace has been the earnest desire of Nepali people and this becomes critically important for the consolidation of hard earned political achievements.
As a country that steered through the uniquely successful peace process, Nepal is confident that we have the capacity and necessary political will to conclude the transitional justice process in equally unique and satisfactory way.
Dear Friends,
Often times, the legacy of a conflict is very complex and generate contradictory perspectives because of the intrinsic plurality of social memories. The subtlety and criticality of the issue demands us to avoid generalization and consider all nuances into account. We must find a way to address the grievances of the victims, and accommodate the long term need of the society and the nation to build sustainable peace.
Building peace in post conflict situation is a complex process that requires restoring political machinery and civil service, holding free elections, drafting a new constitution, guaranteeing a minimum physical security, stabilizing the economy, rebuilding the economic infrastructure, reintegrating the former armed group, helping the victim, keeping the confidence of international community and finally tackling the transitional justice.
On top of that, ensuring ownership of all political forces in the process remains critical element to the success of a peace process.
In Nepal we broadly achieved all these elements through a long but inclusive process of dialogue and accommodation, mutual respect and negotiation taking the supreme interest of the country at the centre by all stakeholders. They were the key elements for the success of Nepali peace process.
As we consolidate peace for achieving far reaching political, social, and economic reforms, we consider that development, democracy and respect for human rights are interdependent and mutually reinforcing.
Our peace process had an organic evolution that addressed root causes of the conflict through a democratic restructuring of the State in an inclusive, transparent and participatory manner taking into account the great diversity of Nepal. This process was enriched by the contributions from the civil society, media, and scholars alike.
Since the Government has expressed willingness to plug the perceived shortcomings in the TRC Act by way of amendment, we need to allow the institutions to function and look for the outcome. We cannot be misled by conjecture. The CIDEP is tasked with the publication of its report based on the evidence and appreciation of the facts. The final result of the two commissions will certainly demonstrate the aspects of truth and justice that we want the two commissions to deliver on.
Government of Nepal has reiterated that the perpetrators of the serious violations of human rights will not go unpunished. Similarly, the independence and impartiality of the Commission will be guaranteed and adequate resources including budgetary, technical, and human will be provided by the Government of Nepal.
To conclude, let me stress that human life is highly regarded in our culture. The idea of justice has had a deep reverence for compassion, repentance, and forgiveness. These values along with the principles of rehabilitation, reformation, reconciliation, and transformation have always been showing us the path towards full respect for dignity of human life.
We need to reflect on our past, contemplate the future, and carry forward the present to bring a closure to our painful memories.
In the capacity of the active participant of Nepali Peace Process, I have interacted with the family members of the victims. I can feel the sufferings of them. To wait the beloved one every day and night without any rays of hope is one of the most painful situation of human life. I express my personal commitment as well to conclude this process at earliest.
So far the Convention on Enforced Disappearances is concerned, Nepal is closely studying this, and will take due consideration in the right course of time. I would like to update you that Nepal is the country which is the party of almost all major treaties and conventions related to Human Rights.
I wish you all to have a fruitful and engaging sessions ahead. I hope that the deliberations that you will have here today will be valuable to those that need it the most.
I thank you all.

Speech delivered by the Hon. Mr. Pradeep Kumar Gyawali at a Symposium on “Reiwa Era: Japan’s Foreign Policy and Nepal-Japan Relations”
Posted onMay 24, 2019 

Speech to be delivered by the Hon. Mr. Pradeep Kumar Gyawali, Minister for Foreign Affairs, at a Symposium on
“Reiwa Era: Japan’s Foreign Policy and Nepal-Japan Relations” organized by
Japanese University Alumni Association, Nepal (JUAAN)
24 May 2019

H.E. Masamichi Saigo, Ambassador of Japan to Nepal,
Former Nepali Ambassadors to Japan,
Distinguished Paper Presenter,
Members of JUAAN,
Distinguished guests,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Namaste/Good Afternoon! Konichiwa !
At the outset, I would like to thank the Japanese Universities Alumni Association (JUAAN) for organizing this symposium on a very important and timely theme.
Similarly, I would like to thank Prof. Dr. Khadga K. C. who is going to have an excellent presentation on Reiwa Era, Japan’s Role and Prospect in Changing Global Power Dynamics. I hope, Prof. K. C. will touch upon almost all aspects of Nepal-Japan relations. Valuable comments by eminent discussants will throw light on the importance of the topic. I would like to briefly touch on the theme of today’s symposium.
We are happy that our friendly country Japan has entered a new era after the accession to the throne by His Majesty Emperor of Japan Naruhito in May 1, 2019. On this auspicious occasion, I would like to congratulate the Government and the people of Japan and express best wishes for the continued peace and prosperity of the friendly people of Japan. There will be high-level representation from Nepal in the coronation ceremony of His Majesty the Emperor of Japan in October this year.
Nepal and Japan are traditional friends. Both countries have been enjoying cordial and friendly relations marked by mutual respect, trust, understanding and cooperation ever since the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1956. These relations have been further strengthened by the exchange of high-level visits at different times. My visit to Japan last year and the return visit of the Foreign Minister of Japan His Excellency Taro Kono within two months of my visit have helped further nurture our relationship.
Nepal and Nepali people have tremendous love and goodwill towards Japan and Japanese people .Buddhism has brought our two countries and peoples closer. We have strong people-to-people contacts. In this context, I would like to recall the visit of a Japanese Buddhist Monk Rev. Ekai Kawaguchi who visited Nepal in 1899 on his way to Tibet in search of holy Buddhist scriptures. He was the first Japanese national to visit Nepal. He introduced Nepal and the birthplace of Lord Buddha – Lumbini – to the Japanese people through his writings and publications. He laid the foundation of the people-to-people relations between Nepal and Japan. Since then, the people-to-people contacts between the two countries have been expanding. Currently, over 85,000 Nepali people are engaged in various professions in Japan.
Our relations cover political, economic, cultural and people-to-people dimensions.
Japan has been one of the major development partners of Nepal for long time. Japanese development assistance to Nepal dates back to early 1950s. Both countries have signed the Agreement on Technical Cooperation in 2003, under which Nepal receives cooperation in the fields of training, Japanese experts, volunteers, study missions, project type assistance, machinery and equipment, and development studies. Truly speaking, the cooperation of Japan has reached the grass root level in Nepal.
We are happy to note that Kulekhani Hydropower Project, Dhulikhel-Sindhuli-Bardibas Highway Project, TU Teaching Hospital, Nagdhunga Tunnel Construction Project, Improvement of Water Supply System in Pokhara, School Sector Reform Programme, Human Resources Development (JDS) Scholarship are some of the major projects under cooperation of Japan. Government of Nepal highly appreciates Japan for its continued support and cooperation in the socio-economic development endeavours of Nepal. Japanese projects are highly appreciated for their quality and modern technology.
We welcome the decision of the Government of Japan to enlist Nepal as a source country for inviting Nepali workers in the Japanese labour market. The signing of Memorandum of Cooperation on the specified skilled workers in March this year has added new dimension of bilateral cooperation in the labour field.
Tourism is another promising area where both countries have tremendous prospects for cooperation. Every year a significant number of Japanese tourists visit Nepal. In this connection, I am happy to share with you that Nepal Airlines Corporation is going to operate its direct flight between Kathmandu and Osaka sector from early July this year. We are also expecting direct flight of Nepal Airlines Corporation between the capital cities of the two countries.
We believe that operation of these flights will significantly contribute in making the Visit Nepal Year 2020 a success.
We appreciate Japan for its active role as an observer in the SAARC. The establishment of SAARC-Japan Special Fund (SJSF) has facilitated implementation of many activities since its inception in 1993.
As the current Chair of the SAARC, we sincerely appreciate the Government of Japan for its assistance to SAARC members in various fields.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
The world is in the state of flux. New developments are taking place with speed and pace not witnessed before. The change has both positive as well as negative prospects. Safe and secure future of the world depends on the proper management of change.
The world is interconnected and interdependent. Interdependence among the countries across the world is growing stronger. Cooperation among the countries is expanding and deepening. Yet trends of unilateralism, protectionism and populism are also rising. This has generated confusion, uncertainties and contradictions.
It is known to all that geo-political weight of Asia is growing. Global balance of power is shifting to this part of the world. With the changes in global power structures, norms and values are also naturally redefined. Increasing competition for either maintaining or gaining supremacy is the fact of the day.
We need a peaceful and harmonious world where all countries get opportunities to grow and prosper. We stand for a just, fair, inclusive and equitable world order founded on the principles of sovereign equality, mutual respect, non-interference and cooperation.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Japan’s rapid socio-economic development within a short span of time has been notable. It has the experience of growing out of the worst devastation caused by the rivalries among the powerful countries. It truly understands the value of peace and harmony.
I am confident that the new Reiwa Era, that is interpreted as a beautiful harmony will be successful in developing harmony among different countries and civilizations. It will be successful in promoting commonalities that bind us together.
To conclude, once again I would like to thank the JUAAN for organizing this important symposium. I believe that compilation of today’s in-depth discussions will be useful for all readers.
Thank you!

Address by Rt. Hon. K P Sharma Oli, Prime Minister of Nepal at Nepal-Cambodia Business Forum
Phnom Penh, 14 May 2019
 
Your Excellency Samdech Akka Moha Sena Padei Techo Hun Sen, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Cambodia
Hon. Minister of Trade of Cambodia
Neak Okhnha Kith Meng, President, Cambodia Chamber of Commerce,
Distinguished Members of the Business Community both from Cambodia and Nepal
Friends from Media,
Ladies and gentlemen:
 
Good afternoon and Namaste !
It is a great pleasure to be amongst the captains of industry and business here in Phnom Penh, beautiful capital city of Cambodia.
I have brought a strong business delegation with me to take part in this important event.
I am on an official visit to Cambodia, the first-ever visit by a Prime Minister of Nepal.
Prime Minister Samdech Hun Sen and I have met three times in less than a year. We had the privilege of welcoming him on an official visit in Kathmandu in late November last year. Prior to that we had a meeting in September in New York on the sidelines of the 73rd UN General Assembly. This shows our growing engagements and deeper interaction between our two countries.
Thank you, dear Prime Minister, for your kind invitation to visit this country of lovely and brave people. I have been touched by the overpouring of warmth, love and affection. You have been a generous host.
I am grateful to you, Mr. Prime Minister, for your kind presence in this meeting. This has profoundly inspired and will continue to inspire our business community to work together in realizing huge potentials that exist between our two countries for development.
Mr. Prime Minister, this also demonstrates your strong commitment to promote economic cooperation between our two countries. I am committed to forging strong partnership with you in advancing our economic ties for the mutual benefit of our peoples.
I am convinced that Nepal can learn a lot from Cambodia’s rapid economic development and its continuous journey to prosperity. This is more so in the context of the history of conflict in our countries and our resilience and determination to rebuild our nations.
Cambodia has transformed a lot since my last visit five years ago under the dynamic and visionary leadership of Prime Minister Hun Sen. Success does not come automatically. It requires a clear vision, strong commitment, determined efforts and right mix of policies, institutions and resources. And, you have successfully proved this.

Dear Friends,
Nepal stands at a historical juncture. We have resolved our political issues and we are now single-mindedly focused on socio-economic transformation.
Today, country’s international standing depends on economic development and prosperity. Economic relations increasingly dominate the substance of inter-state engagements.
“Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali” is our national aspiration. A long-term development vision (a 25-year vision) is being crafted to meet this aspiration. We have a target of graduating from LDC status at an early date, of becoming a middle-income country and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.
Meeting these targets would require huge investments –in infrastructures, in human resources and in financial sector. Our domestic resources alone are not sufficient to meet these targets.
We, therefore, need support, cooperation and solidarity of the friendly countries like Cambodia.
It is with this objective in mind that I have come to this friendly country. We want to advance the process of economic engagement on both tracks-government-to-government and business-to-business.
Dear Friends,
I would like to make a special appeal to the business community of our two countries to jointly explore business opportunities in Nepal. Yesterday, our two countries signed two important instruments with the aim of enhancing economic and trade partnership between our two countries. We must take full advantage of the opportunities provided by these vital instruments.
We welcome foreign investment in Nepal to complement our efforts.
In this context, I would underline the following points for consideration of the Government and private sector of Cambodia:
First policy stability. With the formation of strong government with over two-thirds majority in the parliament, political stability has been achieved. The phase of political uncertainty and instability that characterized our past has now fortunately been over. Stable government means stability and consistency in policy. This is a fundamental prerequisite for foreign investment. And, we have met this fundamental criterion.
Second, strong and sound regulatory framework. We have undertaken a substantial reform to make Nepal an attractive destination for investment. Foreign Investment and Technology Transfer Act has been thoroughly revised to make it consistent with the requirements of the changed context with substantial protection measures for investors.
Likewise, we have enacted Public-Private Partnership and Investment Act to forge synergetic partnership with private sector to mobilize much needed investment in crucial sectors, including infrastructure development. Our reform process will continue and the next cycle of reform will involve issues related to intellectual property rights, among others.
Third, simplification of processes and procedures. We have simplified and streamlined the procedures to facilitate the investors. One stop service centre will come into operation from tomorrow. This will bring all relevant agencies in one place to facilitate the proposals for investment in a time-bound manner. Simplified and liberal visa rules apply to the investors and their dependents. Laws and rules pertaining to land acquisition, company registration, environment assessment and infrastructure development have been simplified and relaxed.
Fourth, market availability and access. Nepal is situated between the two largest economies of the world, India and China. Nepal enjoys preferential market access in both countries. We have given added emphasis to build strong connectivity network with both of our neighbours and serious works are underway in respect of constructing railways, roadways and inland waterways. Enhanced cross-border connectivity will greatly facilitate trade, tourism and investment. Our domestic market is also expanding with increased purchasing power of the people. In addition, Nepal is an active member of two regional organizations, SAARC and BIMSTEC where LDCs like Nepal has certain advantages in terms of regional market access. Beyond this, Nepal, by virtue of its status as an LDC, enjoys preferential access in EU and other developed countries.
Nepal also aims to increase participation in Global Value Chains (GVCs) which will bring capital and new technologies.
Our major constraint emanates from limited production capacity. Market access is not a problem.
Fifth Nepal’s incentives are striking. There is no dearth of natural and human resources. We are rich in both. 57 percent of working age population is a huge demographic dividend. We are endowed with natural resources and cultural treasures. Our water is a precious resource. It has the potential to change the development landscape of Nepal and other countries in the region.
For investors, Nepal is a virgin land. Investment anywhere and everywhere is full of potentials with assured rate of return. There are opportunities for investment in other sectors such as agriculture, mineral resources, medicinal herbs, hospitality industry and financial markets.
Large number of English speaking and digitally connected youths are our important assets. This makes ICT sector another area for profitable investment. Labour cost is low and competitive. We have flexible labour policy. A universal, contribution-based social security system is being implemented. It has ended the possibility of labour strikes and frequent industrial disputes. We have introduced low tax regimes and created conducive fiscal environment. Our tax regime is transparent, predictable and investor friendly.
Recently, we successfully organised the Investment Summit. The Summit saw participation from over 40 countries where the investors have pledged to finance 18 mega projects. The Summit has set the tone. Now it is incumbent upon us to work seriously and get realized the promises and pledges made during the Summit. We have initiated the follow up process by establishing a credible mechanism.
We invite you to invest in the development of Industrial Park and in garment processing zone in the Special Economic Zone. Government is providing supporting building roads and transmission line connectivity. We provide tax rebate for the industries established within SEZ and under developed regions.
Dear Friends,
Lumbini is the birthplace of Siddhartha Gautam Shakya Muni and the fountain of Buddhism, and Cambodia is predominantly a Buddhist country. This is a strong link between our two countries among other several connecting factors.
We would like to welcome more and more sisters and brothers from Cambodia to Lumbini. To facilitate your travel, we are going to operationalize an international airport in Bhairahawa, just 22 KM east of Lumbini, towards the end of this year. We are talking in a positive way to establish direct air connection between our two countries. This will greatly facilitate the travel of Buddhist pilgrims and other visitors to Lumbini.
The Government of Nepal will soon start consultation with relevant authorities to host International Day of Vesak in Lumbini. I request Prime Minister Samdech Hun Sen to support our bid and also encourage citizens of this country to visit Nepal. Thank you, Prime Minister, for accepting my invitation to visit Nepal and go to Lumbini.
We are firmly committed to the development of Lumbini to make it a city of world peace, harmony and understanding.
With this I conclude my remarks.
Thank you for the wonderful opportunity provided to me. Also, thank you for hosting this very important event.

Address by Prime Minister of Nepal Rt. Hon. K P Sharma Oli at the UN Day of Vesak
12 May 2019, Ha Nam, Viet Nam
“Buddhist Approach to Global Leadership and Shared Responsibilities for Sustainable Societies”
Most Venerable Dr. Thich Thein Nhon, President, International Congress Day of Vesak
Most Venerable Prof. Dr. Phra Brahmapundit, President, International Council for Day of Vesak
Most Venerable Monks
His Excellency Nguyen Xuan Phuc, Prime Minister of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam
His Excellency President of Myanmar
His Excellency Vice President of India
Excellencies
Scholars
Ladies and Gentlemen:
I have brought warm greetings to you all from the land of Buddha and Sagarmatha; from sisters and brothers of Nepal !
I want to chorus with you- Bhavatu Sabba Mangalam ! ( May All be blessed to Auspiciousness)
Nepal is a land of wonderful people. The only thing they cherish is friendship with all and enmity with none.
The only thing they wish is peace, not only at their home, but also in the entire world, entire universe.
This fits well into this grand ceremony whose very objective is to foster understanding and harmony in a world that is marred by conflicts, tensions, uncertainties and contradictions. We believe in universal fraternity and harmony to be the guiding norms to govern relationship between states and their peoples.
Truly, this is an unforgettable opportunity for me and my country to be represented in this august UN Vesak Day celebration in a country with which we share not only a strong political relationship but equally strong cultural relationship, that brings our peoples closer.
Thank you, Prime Minister Phuc, for the kind invitation and for the warm welcome and generous hospitality.
Ladies and Gentlemen, 
No words would capture the essence and importance of this day. On this very full moon day some 2643 years ago, the immortal son of the world, whom we reverently call Buddha, descended to this world. On the same day 35 years later, he achieved enlightenment and finally at the age of 80, some 2563 years ago he assimilated in the eternal peace. Such is the solemnity of the day.
I come from the blessed land where Buddha was born. It was a little hamlet in the southern plains of Nepal, where the seed of Buddhism was sown and its early sapling was nurtured. That was why Siddhartha Gautam gave up his crown princeship, his palace, his lovely wife, a cute and innocent son. He had got something and was willing to get more. Lumbini is therefore not only the birthplace of Buddha, but also the fountain of Buddhism.
Today, this place is the centre of attraction for pilgrims, scholars, researchers and those in quest of the ultimate truth and salvation !
Lumbini is more than this. It was an integral part of Shakya Ganarajya (Shakya Republic) with its Capital in Kapilvastu. It was an advanced city state by all standards of that period. Organized in the principle of republican system of governance, it was a flourishing republic and with a kingship elected by the people and thus governed under the able leadership of Shakyas. The recent excavation establishes the cultural and architectural significance of the Shakya Ganarajya. It was in this very land, the famous philosopher Kapil invented the ‘Sankhya’, known as the philosophy of numbers.
As Buddhism spread to the rest of Asia and the world, transferred alongside was the vast collection of knowledge and wisdom, ideas about life and livelihood, messages about social harmony and universal fraternity.
Today, the shared asset of Buddhism connects countries in Asia and beyond, including Nepal and Vietnam. Many of our people follow Buddhism as their core faith and the rest respect it as a pool of enlightened ideas and source of inspiration.
I am impressed by the great efforts of the people and Government of Vietnam towards preserving and promoting the treasure of Buddhism. I deem this Conference as a landmark in the continuum of the same admirable endeavor.
Dear Friends, 
Buddhism has served for generations as the fountain of humanity; as the belief system focused on the quest for betterment of human beings, society and the world.
Like other belief systems, Buddhism, too, talks about the distinction between the worldly and the eternal, the transient and the endless. Yet, the unique appeal of Buddhism lies in its care of life and nature. One does not have to wait for the next life or another world to find happiness. Ultimate joy can be attained by anyone, any time, in this very world, in this very life. For this, we should just discard the hatred, self-interest and violence, and should fill ourselves with the spirit of compassion, fraternity and benevolence.
Buddhism thus seeks to empower people. Buddhism is rediscovery of humanity; disciplining, organizing and transforming of oneself, and, by setting example, transforming the rest of society. Its ultimate aim is to attain harmonious organization of society and world order: order that is based on justice, universal fraternity, peaceful co-existence, and human dignity.
In recognition of Buddhism’s contribution to world peace and harmony, the United Nations, whose very Charter is based on the Buddhist values of cooperation and co-existence, recognized, in the year 1999, ‘the Day of Vesak’. Such recognition should be a matter of pride for us.
Most Venerable and Excellencies,
And this is why Buddhism is relevant when it comes to the question of larger global leadership today. In fact, Buddha’s entire life is the testimony of ‘lead by example’. Without second thought, we can say that Buddha was a great visionary leader, who inspired people to shun vices and embrace virtues. He was able to reach the people and communities with love and compassion and lead them on the path of patience and perseverance amidst adversities of all kinds.
Buddha set an example that modesty and humility are the true traits of leadership, not aggression and ego. He passed on to the succeeding leadership the cognizance of the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path. Right view, Right intention, Right action, Right effort, Right speech are as much the fundamental qualities of today’s leadership as they were in the past.
Leadership is about having right vision of destination for society and guiding people on right path. But it is certainly not about being swayed by popular whims and momentary delusions. It is about right intention to bring positive results and serving for larger public good, not self-gratification. It is about creating harmony in society, promoting fraternity and treating everyone with respect and dignity.
Dear Friends, 
Generosity and moral integrity are on top of all attributes of leadership that we can draw from Buddha’s teachings. Speaking to his principal disciple Ananda, Buddha made it a point that leadership is self-making, self-driving and self-motivating process.
‘Live and let live’ is the core tenet of Buddhism that immensely contributed to the wider Asian values of caring, sharing and pursuing larger societal good.
These noble traits are antithesis to silo mentality and divisive mindset that are increasingly finding space, particularly in today’s political spectrum in several parts of the world.
Today, society is getting more individualistic, consumerism is overshadowing the human values of auspiciousness and countries are becoming more inward-looking. Rhetoric of exclusion is gaining more traction than the message of inclusion. Short-term transactions are being prioritized at the cost the long-term peace, stability and harmony in the world.
Further, global geopolitics is getting fluid and full of uncertainties. The order that was created and the institutions that were built as modus operandi for countries and communities to work together are losing their hold. Existing multilateral system is under attack. Sense of shared responsibilities is dissipating.
True that we live in a world today, which is more prosperous than ever; wealthier than ever. Yet, one fifth of its humanity still lives under abject poverty, deprived of even the most basic needs, while the world’s military expenditure is getting higher every year.
The idea of economic justice is sounding more alien to us. The objective to realize the Sustainable Development Goals is facing challenge in receiving adequate international support.
Environmental degradation goes unchecked and the very sustainability of the world is under threat, thus posing the very question of existentiality. Paris Agreement on climate change survives amidst an uncertain fate. Terrorism continues to threaten peace and order in societies.
Amidst such disruptions, the core Asian values of universal fraternity, “Basudhaibakutumbakam” (the world is one family), peaceful co-existence and sense of sharing become all the more relevant for today’s leadership. The faithful observance of Panchasheel will serve as an important guide to foster understanding and harmony.
The notion of balance and Middle Path gains even greater significance; notion that demands us to shun excesses, accommodate diversities, find the ground for compromises; a path that world help avoid conflicts and chaos.
In our quest for peace, stability and sustainable future, pathway shown by Buddha always remains pertinent. Buddha’s messages emphasize balance and equilibrium between man and nature, between material and spiritual, between the day-to-day affairs and the perpetual.
Buddhism is strong against the three vices, namely ignorance or delusion (Moha), greed (Raga) and hatred (Dvesha), which are, in one way or other, the main causes of the crises the world is facing even today.
Strong linkage between Buddhism and nature needs no emphasis as everything we understand by Buddhism was systematized and formulated under a Bodhi tree, within the nature. Buddhism is about eschewing excessive desires, including desire for material possession.
As it is often said, famines do not occur due to lack of food; it occurs when there is no justice in distribution; it occurs due to culture of amassing more than what we need. Kindness and compassion are the main virtues to make human beings happy. When the culture of giving, sharing and helping others is predominant, society becomes blissful. In genuine philanthropy, givers and receivers are happy together.
Happy individuals are the key constituents of a happy society. Happiness depends both on the external nature and the inner self and Buddhism has answer to both. One of the treasure troves Buddhism offers for happiness is the art of “Dhyana” (meditation), which is getting increasingly popular. “The Dhyana” (meditation) is the state of concentration of mind which brings mental peace, thus making our physical being healthy and ultimately contributes to the foundation of peaceful society.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
In this conversation about transformation towards peaceful and sustainable society, I feel inspired to share with you some thoughts on the kind of historic transformation Nepal and Nepali society have been able to achieve in recent past.
The home-grown peace process that we accomplished is a rare case and hence a topic of interest for study and research worldwide. Our journey of transformation from bullet to ballot is exemplary one, which is a testimony of how peace prevails eventually. We have not only ended the ten year long armed conflict but also brought the conflicting parties into peaceful political process.
An inclusive democratic constitution has been promulgated by an inclusive body of directly elected people’s representative, replicating the egalitarian Sangha way of Buddhism. Through the Constitution, people’s agendas have been established and a country that once suffered the brunt of conflict and violence is now marching proudly and with high optimism on the path of peace, stability and prosperity. Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali is our national aspiration.
Such transformation has been possible in the land of Buddha, land of Peace!
Dear Friends,
Buddha, Buddhism and Lumbini are inseparable. Buddhism cannot be disassociated from Buddha; it also cannot be disassociated from Lumbini.
To understand Buddha it is important to understand Lumbini. Visit to Lumbini is, therefore, once in a lifetime experience for those who follow Buddhism and those who admire its grandeur.
The birthplace of Buddha welcomes you with boundless affection.
The Government of Nepal wish to host United Nations Vesak Day programme in Lumbini. We are also planning to organize an international conference on Buddhism next year.
I take this opportunity to extend a cordial invitation to you all in Nepal.
To ease your travel, we are going soon to complete the works for the Gautam Buddha International Airport, which is about 20 KM east from Lumbini, and bring it into operation.
Lumbini’s development is in our priority. We have a plan to develop Lumbini as an international Peace City and a revered place for all humanity, for all Buddhists across the world, and for those who have interest and belief in the principles laid by Buddha.
Finally, I wish to thank the organizers for inviting me to speak on such a solemn occasion and on such a pertinent theme. I am grateful to all of you for your presence and patience.
Thank you !

Address by Rt. Hon. K P Sharma Oli, Prime Minister of Nepal 
at Viet Nam-Nepal Business Forum
Hanoi, 10 May 2019
Vu Tien Loc, President, Viet Nam Chamber of Commerce and Industry,
Distinguished Members of the Business Community both from Viet Nam and Nepal 
Friends from Media,
Ladies and gentlemen:
It is a distinct pleasure to be among you all here in Hanoi. I would like to thank the organizers for making an excellent arrangement for this programme. 
I feel inspired to meet here the leaders from business community, investors and entrepreneurs. 
While sharing this platform with you here today, I feel more optimistic for closer economic collaborations in the days to come. 
Leaders of Nepali business community are also with me here as part of my delegation. 
Together we have brought a clear message –the government as well as the private sector in Nepal are determined in their journey to prosperity. 
I hope the business delegation will make the best use of this platform to interact with their Vietnamese counterpart in exploring business and investment linkages between Nepal and Vietnam.
Dear Friends,
Our two countries have been enjoying excellent friendship bolstered by social, cultural and religious affinity.
We share a cordial relationship –based on the principles of non-interference and mutual respect. 
There is an immense potential to strengthen our economic relations as well.
The economic transformation of Viet Nam after the introduction of Doi-Moi reforms has been remarkable. 
Viet Nam’s story of transformation from a war-torn agrarian economy to a vibrant middle-income country is truly inspiring to all of us. It has shined as one of the bright stars of emerging economies. 
Viet Nam has not only grown, but has also increased its welfare gains. Your growth process has been an inclusive one and therefore a model for achieving sustainable development.
This has been possible only due to the leadership of Vietnamese government and business sector and the hard work of Vietnamese people. In this success story of Vietnam’s ascent, the role of Vietnamese business community is truly outstanding. 
Your boundless energy is an inspiration to us. 
Your spectacular success is an encouragement to us. 
Dear Friends,
Today, Nepal stands at a historical juncture. 
The country has emerged as a Federal Republic after the fall of monarchy. We had to pass through a difficult insurgency and decade long political transition. With the promulgation of new constitution in 2015, the peace process has come to a logical end. 
Nepal has gone through political transformation of tremendous scale.
Now, our ambition is of economic transformation – of equally tremendous scale.
The elections held in 2017, gave a strong mandate to my party and now we have a stable government in Nepal. Two largest communist/left parties have unified as one. The government enjoys over two-thirds majority in the Parliament.
With the consolidation of political changes, now Nepal has entered the phase of economic build-up. 
Nepal has been a remarkable success story of peace process.
Now, our ambition is of socio-economic prosperity –of equally remarkable success.
 The Government has a motto of “Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali”. We have a vision of graduating from the LDCs at an early date, to become a middle-income country and to achieve Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. 
The government is currently working on the concept paper for the Nepal’s development called “Vision 2100”.
Realization of this dream requires huge investments –in infrastructures, in human resources, in financial sector . 
Dear Friends,
Nepal has now emerged as a confident nation –which is aware of its capabilities and potentials; which is aware of its resources and prospects. 
We are determined to build a prosperous nation –with resolute domestic efforts coupled with international cooperation.
Recently, we successfully organised the Investment Summit. The Summit saw participation from over 40 countries including Viet Nam. During the Summit, investors have pledged to finance 18 mega projects. 
For investors, Nepal is a virgin land. Investment anywhere and everywhere is full of potentials with assured rate of return.
Nepal’s advantage lies in our rich natural resources, abundance of labour forces and our location between two largest markets. Investment in Nepal will open avenues to the world’s two largest markets; India and China.
There are opportunities for investment in multiple sectors –hydropower, agriculture, mineral resources, medicinal herbs, hospitality industry and financial markets.
As an LDC, we have preferential access to some of the international markets. 
Labour cost is low and competitive. 
The country enjoys a demographic dividend, with 57 percent of working-age population. Every year over 500 thousand youths enter into job market. 
Large number of English speaking and digitally connected youths are our important asset. This makes ICT sector another area for profitable investment.
With the increase in household incomes, our domestic market is also increasing. Our active participation in regional forums is extending our market size.
The cultural similarly and shared aspiration of prosperity makes the business engagement easier. 
We are developing international airports at two prime touristic hubs of Pokhara and Lumbini. 
Dear Friends,
We have been incessantly pursuing for making Nepal a prominent investment and business destination. 
Political stability has ensured policy stability and consistency. The Government has clear objectives, goals and direction for country’s development.
We have created an investment-friendly environment through the enactment of necessary laws and announcement of a series of policy measures. Protection of foreign investment is guaranteed by law. 
The new Foreign Investment and Technology Transfer Act ensures national treatment to foreign investment.
We have adopted liberal investment and business policies; simplified the procedures; ensured one stop service to open and close business ventures. We have allowed foreign investment in almost all sectors. Negative list is kept at minimum.
Private sector is taken on board as an indispensable partner for economic development. Public -Private Partnership and Investment Act has paved the way for synergetic engagement of both sides for investment.
We have flexible labour policy. 
A universal, contribution-based social security system is being implemented. It has ended the possibility of labour strikes and frequent industrial disputes.
We have introduced low tax regimes and created conducive fiscal environment. Our tax regime is transparent, predictable and investor friendly. 
Simplified and liberal visa rules apply to the investors and their dependents. 
Laws and rules pertaining to land acquisition, company registration, environment assessment and infrastructure development have been simplified and relaxed.
The government has made several attempts like agricultural modernisation, digitisation and Youth Employment programmes. 
Nepal Investment Board which I chair is a dedicated organization that looks after major investment projects. Similarly, the Department of Industry and Industrial Promotion Board further augment existing investment mechanism. 
Our government machinery is easily accessible. We have robust institutional setup. 
Nepal also aims to increase participation in Global Value Chains (GVCs) which will bring capital and new technologies. 
The success of competitive and economic development lies in innovation and knowledge. We aspire to innovate at level of small and medium sized enterprises as well.
Dear Friends,
The signing of Memorandum of Understanding between Nepal and Viet Nam on Framework Agreement on Promotion of Trade and Investment will boost economic cooperation between the two countries. 
This will augment the activities on business community of both countries including Chambers. 
Our efforts for regional and global connectivity have further enhanced and intensified which will reduce the time and costs of access to markets.
As I said before, investment in Nepal will open up avenues to the world’s two largest markets. Simplified transit system with India is in place. An Agreement on Transit Transport and its Protocol with China have enhanced the access to the sea.
Multi-modal transit transport system has reduced the delivery of goods reducing transit transport costs. 
Furthermore, we are motivated by digital connectivity which will compensate geographical landlockedness. 
Dear Friends,
The vast untapped resources and virgin fields for investment makes Nepal an attractive
business destination. 
The market-friendly incentives, business-friendly liberal policy, and robust institutional mechanism make Nepal a profitable business destination.
Peace, security and rule of law make Nepal a safe business destination.

Speech by Prime Minister Rt. Hon. K P Sharma Oli
at the Ho Chi Minh National Academy of Politics
Hanoi, 10 May 2019
Pro. Dr. Nguyen Xuan Thang,
President of the Ho Chi Minh National Academy of Politics
Distinguished Participants,
Friends, Ladies and Gentlemen:
Namaste and Good Afternoon!
My dream to visit this prestigious academy has come true today. 
This academy, established as a special tribute to a great socialist leader of the world and a national leader of freedom, Comrade Ho Chi Minh, occupies a special place in the socialist and national independence movement.
Let me begin by pondering these questions. Why the world so profoundly admires Ho Chi Minh? What were his attributes that made him a towering personality and an iconic figure? What lessons can we learn from his life and contributions to public life? 
While answering these questions we may not get fuller understanding of the circumstances that gave birth to this hero. Yet, a deeper reflection on these points would surely tell us the most important aspects of his brilliant career.
Uncle Ho, as he was popularly called, was an extraordinary leader who changed the course of history, who made his country and people proud, and who gave the socialist movement in the world a new direction and dynamism.
He sets an example of how a visionary leader can transform his country amidst several adversities and becomes a constant and boundless source of inspiration for millions of people around the world, fighting for rights, freedoms and dignity.
He epitomizes the national strengths and courage that how a popular leader receives unconditional, unqualified and spontaneous support of the people and mobilizes that to defeat the mighty army on earth, setting an extraordinary example of performance in the war against foreign interference and domination.
He was a man of principle and dignity on which he never compromised. He was never deviated from his path of freedom and justice even in the face of imminent threat to his life. Unlike a few revolutionaries, he never sought to work for power and position. 
Judging against his contributions to the world, especially in leading socialist and nationalist movements, I would say that he was not an individual, but an institution, embodying and defining the true meaning of socialism and transformation.
That is why his footprints are the most visible and popularly followed.
He is a highly respected and deeply admired world leader in my country where several poems, essays and lyrics have been devoted in reverence of this great son of earth. 
The Vietnamese revolution and the movement for national liberation spearheaded by the Communist Party under the able guidance of Ho Chi Minh have been a source of great inspiration for Nepal’s own socialist, democratic and patriotic movements. 
Though Nepal was never colonized, we also fought against foreign imperialist power to preserve our sovereignty and independence. This has helped foster solidarity and camaraderie between the people of our two countries.
That is why; we spontaneously and wholeheartedly demonstrated strong solidarity with fellow brothers and sisters of this land in their fight for independence, emancipation and national unity. 
For me personally, Uncle Ho is the beacon of inspiration. His vision and thoughts constantly inspired me to fight for democracy and people’s rights irrespective of where I was, whether inside the jail or in a solitary confinement as a political prisoner or in the street as an active political campaigner.
Dear Friends,
In the past forty-five years of unification, Vietnam has not only achieved national reconciliation, but also remarkable progress in all domains. 
As a country sharing similar cultural traditions and values, we have great admiration and appreciation for Vietnam’s forward march.
Vietnam’s contemporary history has lessons for all of us – it shows how to rebuild a war-torn nation from scratch. We have also the challenge of rebuilding and reconstruction in the post conflict situation.
Indeed, Vietnam’s ingenious application of Marxism in its unique national circumstances has continued to inspire the people of Nepal in exploring the most suitable and durable solutions to the multiple challenges that we face in our country today.
With the creative application of Marxism, socialist movements in both of our countries proved instrumental in abolishing the feudal institutions of monarchy.
Both of our countries have undergone fundamental political transformation over the years and have set ambitious trajectories for economic growth and development. In this context, learning from each other’s experiences could be beneficial to both. 
My current visit is an opportunity to acquire firsthand knowledge about Viet Nam’s recent developments and socio-economic transformation. I look forward to receiving your informed perspectives on these fronts.
Dear Friends:
Like in Vietnam, we in Nepal have always sought to innovatively apply and adapt Marxist ideas to the local context in the pursuit of building socialism under the leadership of the Communist Party.
In fact, the pursuit of socialism remains our important constitutional goal.
In its one hundred-year history, the world socialist movement has undergone various practices and experiments, ups and downs, and successes and setbacks.
In the midst of such ebb and flow, the rise and success of the communist party in Nepal amply shows that the socialist movement is relevant forever for people’s emancipation. 
Experiences of Nepal and Viet Nam have proved it. Our experience in Nepal shows us that revolutionary changes are possible by peaceful means as well. 
The socialist movement may have suffered setbacks and upheavals, but will always come back with even greater steam and power for the liberation of the people. A few instances of failures and setbacks should not lead us to believe that socialism is irrelevant and obsolete.
We strongly believe that socialism provides a correct answer to current world problems. It is the future of humanity. As the global capitalist finance is facing severe challenges, and as the neoliberalism is in endless crisis, relevancy of socialism has become more pronounced. 
We must, however, bear in mind that the socialism in the 21st century must incorporate new dynamism. It should cope with the changed context and adjust to local realities. That is why we should acknowledge the diverse paths and models. We should respect the independent choice of model in a particular country. Principle should be for the cause of practice. Practices should not be confined to irrelevant dogmas.
Dear Friends:
The source of our innovative practice of Marxism and the socialist cause goes back to the end of the twentieth century. 
Around the late 1980s and early 1990s, the international socialist movement was facing a serious setback.
Just at that time, the revolutionary programme of people’s leader Madan Bhandari re-oriented Nepal’s democratic movement for political rights and freedoms to a new direction. 
Under his leadership and guidance, we embraced a pluralist political structure within the ambit of the Marxist philosophy. ‘People’s Multiparty Democracy’ was the principle, which successfully guided us in the changed context through these tumultuous years.
We adopted the ideas of political supremacy through competition and multi-party contestation and the guarantee of fundamental rights and freedoms under a constitutional framework.
Sometimes, the values of a pluralist polity and constitutional democracy that we practiced are confused with a capitalist system. 
This is not the case. 
The values of competition and democracy of the people are the achievements of the political struggles waged by the people of Nepal for a long period of time. 
The very first slogan put forward by the Communist Party of Nepal in its inception was ‘Guarantee the Civilian Rights’. The Communist Party pioneered the democratic movement in Nepal.
We believe that we have made creative application of Marxism in Nepal that serves the unique conditions of our country.
The communist party must win the hearts and minds of the people, and always serve the people as their faithful agents. The traits of Ho Chi Minh are extremely important in this context.


Dear Friends: 
The communist movement of Nepal was born under the influence and through the legacy of various streams of people’s movements and struggles.
In early days, our political struggle emerged as a nationalist movement for the unification of the country. 
Later, it took the form of a struggle against British imperialist aggression for the preservation of sovereignty and territorial integrity. 
The movement sought social reforms and took the shape of ‘humanist’ struggles against various forms of discrimination in society. 
After the establishment of Nepal Communist Party, our movement acquired a revolutionary character and socialist orientation.
As a result, the despotic Rana Regime was overthrown and we entered into a modern democratic era. Our democratic experiment was, however, short lived.
In the changed context, our struggle was directed against autocratic monarchy and all forms of feudalism. We relentlessly pursued our political objective of establishing people’s power and supremacy until we made a decisive and final assault on the monarchy and established a federal democratic republican order a decade ago. The Shah dynasty ruled the country for almost two and a half centuries.
Nepal has also invented a unique way of resolving the internal conflict. We pursued an entirely homegrown, nationally owned and led peace process to resolve conflict and paved the way for peaceful pursuit of political objectives. Though we do not intend to prescribe our peace model, I do believe that this could be an important lesson for the countries and people yearning for peace in other troubled regions and countries.
I am glad to state that we have achieved our political objectives under the leadership of the Communist Party working together with other democratic forces in the country.
However, this was not achieved easily. We confronted significant resistance and constraints within and outside the country. We even witnessed various ups and downs, unity and divisions in the communist movement. In the course of political struggle, several of our compatriots made ultimate sacrifice and many more suffered loss of one kind or the other. 
Only last month we celebrated the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party. The unification of two communist parties- Communist Party of Nepal (UML, the largest party) and Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre, the second largest party) last year gave a distinct sense of unity and togetherness in celebrating this important commemorative event.
Dear Friends,
The modern and progressive features of a democratic, inclusive and humanistic polity have been fully reflected and encapsulated in the constitution promulgated in 2015 by an elected constituent assembly.
The people of Nepal exercised their sovereign rights in constitution making. This has fulfilled their long-cherished goal of writing a constitution of the people, by the people and for the people. The left forces in the country led and safeguarded the constitution-making process.
The constitution guarantees all the necessary structural frameworks and mandatory state policies to create a progressive, equitable, inclusive, forward-looking and socialism oriented system.
A notable achievement has been that women are guaranteed one-third of seats in the Federal Parliament, as well as the provincial assemblies. The constitution mandates that a woman must fill the positions of either President or Vice-President of the country and Speaker or Deputy Speaker. At the Local Level, women are guaranteed 40% representation.

The Constitution contains key provisions of a welfare state to guarantee the rights of every segment of society. In childhood, State provides nutrition and education. In young age, it provides the opportunities for jobs. In old age, the Government provides social security. Thus the Government provides care to the people for their entire life.
Dear Friends,
Through the free, fair and impartial elections held in 2017, the people of Nepal have given us the mandate to run the government for political stability and economic prosperity.
Today, the Nepal Communist Party enjoys almost two-thirds majority in federal parliament, as well as in six of the seven provinces and in the majority of local governments. 
It has been established as a party with a strong political base of over 53% of popular votes.
The credit for such overwhelming success of the communist party goes to the creative application of Marxism in Nepal in the form of People’s Multi-Party Democarcy.
We championed the cause of democracy and political rights. 
We befriended the people, shared their joys and sorrows, and lent our unflagging support to their aspirations for a better life.
We stood at the forefront of our patriotic movement.
And, we had full respect for the cultural traditions, beliefs and practices of the people. Unity in diversity is our strength.
Dear Friends:
Today, we have embarked on another journey of nation building, a journey for social progress and economic prosperity. We are determined to eliminate poverty, inequality and backwardness.
Our immediate goal is to graduate from LDC status. We want to become a middle-income country by 2030 and achieve the SDGs by the same timeline. A 25-year development vision is being crafted for the country. 
We seek national rejuvenation and economic transformation in Nepal with socialism showing our path as the leading light. ‘Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali’ remains our national aspiration.
We will focus on developing national leadership, and encourage innovative and indigenous solutions to our development challenges.
And we are also seeking greater collaboration, co-operation and partnership with the outside world in support of our development endeavors.
Dear Friends,
Nepal is a veritable heaven on earth.
Nepal, the birthplace of Buddha and fountain of Buddhism, is a land of profound and timeless spiritual wisdom. 
It is also a land of enormous – and emerging – economic opportunities. 
Therefore, I hope that the economic, social and people-to-people exchanges between Nepal and Vietnam will continue to expand and deepen in the future.
We look forward to welcoming more and more Vietnamese friends visiting Nepal. I am sure they would love to visiting the birthplace of Buddha, Lumbini, to make their life fulfilling and rewarding. 
Nepal offers a unique combination of natural beauty and cultural diversity to make it a tourist paradise.
We would also like to invite greater Vietnamese investments in Nepal. 
I am fully confident that growing interactions and exchanges will elevate Nepal-Vietnam relations to new heights and benefit the peoples of our two countries. 
I am certain that the future of Nepal-Vietnam relations is very bright and promising.
Through collaboration and co-operation in areas of mutual interest, we will continue to promote our mutually beneficial bilateral relations and co-operative partnership. 
 To conclude, dear friends, it has truly been a matter of great honor and privilege for me to address this very important august gathering of scholars, faculties and students at this premier academy today.
I would like to extend my sincere thanks to the Ho Chi Minh National Academy of Politics for this opportunity.
The Academy has left a deep impression on me.
I look forward to continued academic exchanges between our two countries. 
I sincerely thank you all for your participation and patience.

Keynote Speech by Hon. Mr. Pradeep Kumar Gyawali, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Nepal at Nepal-China Economic and Trade Forum
Beijing, 28 April 2019 
Rt. Honorable President Mrs. Bidya Devi Bhandari
Distinguished members of the Nepal-China Business Community,
Members of the Nepali delegation,
Friends from Media,
Ladies and Gentlemen,

I feel honoured to have this opportunity to share a few words at this Nepal-China Economic and Trade Forum being organized with the participation of prominent business leaders from Nepal and China.
I would like to thank the Embassy of Nepal and Economic Joint Committee of China Commercial Stock Enterprises for organizing this important meeting.
Rt. Honourable President has already highlighted the importance of Nepal-China bilateral relations and prospects of doing business in the changed political context in Nepal. To avoid the repetition on some contents, I will be rather brief with particular focus on the potentials in the areas of trade and investment between our two countries. I would also briefly touch upon the various reform measures undertaken by the Government of Nepal to create an investment friendly environment.
As you are aware, Nepal and China have been enjoying excellent relations since the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1955. These relations have been expanding and deepening in multiple areas including economic, cultural, technical and people-to-people relations.
Nepal and China are close neighbours. Our relations are trouble-free.
Nepal is firmly committed to One China policy. We have a principled position that we do not allow our soil to be used against China.
Distinguished Business Leaders!
China has astonished the world with its unprecedented development in a relatively short span of time. It has been moving miraculously from poverty to plenty. Nepal cherishes the progress and prosperity of China. While setting an example of rapid socio-economic development, China has become one of the major sources of foreign direct investment across the world.
As a close neighbour and a friendly country, Nepal wishes to be benefitted from the progress and prosperity of China. Nepal views stable, strong and prosperous China as an opportunity for its development and prosperity.
I am happy to note that China is one of the most important development partners of Nepal. It is also one of the largest trading partners, one of the largest sources of FDI as well as tourists to Nepal.
We appreciate the Government and people of China for their continued support and cooperation to our development efforts.
Economic engagements between our two countries carry a long history. I am happy to share that Nepal served, for a long period of time, as a transit route between China and India and beyond for trade.
Given the changed global context and development needs of Nepal, such engagements need to be revitalized, further deepened and expanded. 

Dear friends!
To our great relief, decade-long political transition in Nepal has come to an end after the promulgation of the Constitution in 2015. As per the spirit of the Constitution, necessary laws have been enacted and the political gains have been institutionalized. A stable government has been formed and development agenda has been set with the motto of “Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali.”
Sole focus of the Government is to uplift the living standard of the people.
We aspire to become a middle-income country by 2030 and graduate from LDC status at an early date. At the same time, we aim to realize the SDGs. To achieve these goals, we require massive investment in infrastructure development and induction of advanced and innovative technology, for which our domestic resources are insufficient. Therefore, we need the support and cooperation of the international community including neighbours to fill in the resources gap.
We welcome foreign investment. We are committed to protecting foreign investment. We have an investment-friendly environment and which will be further improved.
As I said earlier, we have a stable government. Stable government ensures policy stability and consistency, which is a pre-requisite for boosting confidence of the investors.
Political stability also guarantees peace and stability that is essential for the safety and security of the investors and their investment.
With the demographic dividend of working age population in majority, with yet to be tapped huge natural resources, with the increasing domestic market of sizable proportion of middle class, and with the strategic geo-location between the two largest markets of the globe –Nepal is an attractive investment destination.

Dear Friends,
As the CEO of the Nepal Investment Board and the representatives from private sector of Nepal will shortly present about the investment prospects in Nepal, I will briefly share a few words with you on the same topic.
We have introduced major policy changes in order to simplify procedures, maintain clarity and transparency and guarantee the easy repatriation of the profit. In the past few months, we have made substantial progress in improving investment climate in the country. A sound regulatory framework has been established with the enactment of two key legislations: Foreign Investment and Technology Transfer Act; and Public-Private Partnership and Investment Act.
The Public-Private Partnership and Investment Act provides one stop service for any foreign investment of over Nepali Rupees 6 billion or a hydropower project over 200 MW capacity.
Statutory provisions pertaining to land acquisition, company registration, environmental assessment and infrastructure development have been relaxed and simplified.
We offer an attractive incentive package in terms of corporate taxation, import duties, and export facilitation. Tax rates are predictable and tax holidays are guaranteed by the law for those industries that meet the criteria.
Nepal offers tremendous opportunities for the investors. It is still a virgin land for investment in every sector. Almost every sector including hydropower, manufacturing industries, IT, services, tourism, mining, herbal medicines, and agro-based industries is open for foreign investment. Attractive profit the foreign companies are making in Nepal is an evidence that proves investment in Nepal is an opportunity.
Market competition is very low at the moment. Therefore, it is prime time for Chinese companies to enter into Nepali market for reaping optimum profit from their investment.
Investors will also be benefitted by the relatively cheap labour forces available in Nepal. English-speaking human resources are also easily available.
We have signed Bilateral Investment Promotion and Protection Agreements as well as Avoidance of Double Taxation Agreements with a number of countries.
All political parties in Nepal have common voice on the agenda of development and prosperity. It was reflected during the Investment Summit held in Kathmandu last month.
We are highly encouraged by the significant presence of the investors from different countries and international organizations. The largest number of the investors in the Summit was from China. It indicates the growing confidence of the Chinese investors on Nepali market. We expect receiving the largest investment from China.
The Summit was also a reflection of trust and confidence of foreign investors on Nepal. It is an evidence of the proper environment being created for investment in Nepal.

Dear Friends,
Tourism is yet another sector for investment. Nepal has unparalleled natural beauty and incredible cultural treasures. Natural and cultural diversity make Nepal a tourist paradise round the year. The Government has announced the year 2020 as Visit Nepal Year with the aim of attracting 2 million tourists in a year. We also seek investment for upgrading tourism infrastructure, including hotels and resorts.
Therefore, it is opportune time to invest in Nepal. Business environment in Nepal is conducive from all respects.
Tap the opportunities; invest your capital and technology in Nepal, and reap the benefit. I assure you that you will gain while investing in Nepal. And, Nepal will also gain in the form of job creation and trade expansion, among others.
We welcome you in Nepal.
Thank You, Xie Xie!

Speech delivered by Rt. Hon. Mrs. Bidya Devi Bhandari, President of Nepal at the Nepal-China Economic and Trade Forum,
Beijing, 28 April 2019 
Distinguished Business Leaders of Nepal and China,
Friends from Media,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I am happy to address the joint meeting of business community of Nepal and China. I sincerely thank the organizers for hosting this very important event on the occasion of my State visit to this close friendly country.
Nepal and China are neighbours and close friends, sharing a long history of friendship and cooperation. Geography, culture and traditions bind our two countries and peoples.
We are trustworthy friends. We have been faithfully conducting our relations on the basis of the ‘Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence’. Our relations are trouble-free.
Our commitment to One China policy is strong and unshakable. We have taken concrete measures to ensure that our territory is not used for any activities directed against China.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
We have settled political issues through the promulgation of a progressive constitution in September 2015. It has ended decade-long political transition.
We have a stable government, which is the strongest in the history of Nepal. The Government has a clear vision, agenda and direction of the development of the country.
Economic transformation is our priority agenda. We have to move fast to realize people’s ever exorbitant expectations. We do not have luxury to waste time and energy. ‘Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali’ is our national resolve. Our development efforts keep our people at the centre.
 Dear friends, 
Our development challenges are huge and manifold. Our country is endowed with both natural and human resources. But we lack adequate material resources and technology to tap development potentials. Therefore, we need support and cooperation of international community including neighbours to realize our national resolve.
China is our most trusted and reliable development partner. Government and the people of Nepal always appreciate the Government and the people of China for their continued support and assistance to the socio-economic development endeavours of Nepal.
BRI has opened the additional windows of opportunities for investment. I would like to urge the Chinese entrepreneurs and businessmen to tap its benefits.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
We have an-investment friendly environment in Nepal. Political stability has ensured policy stability and security of the investors.
Comprehensive reforms related to policy, structural and procedural matters have been undertaken for investment protection. Process of reform will continue.
We are going to operationalize one stop centre soon to facilitate foreign investors. At present, tax regime in Nepal is liberal and predictable.
Multinationals companies working in Nepal are making good return of their investment. This confirms that Nepal is an attractive destination for investment.
Last month, Nepal successfully hosted Investment Summit. Let me happily share with you that presence of the Chinese entrepreneurs was the largest in the Summit.
We welcome substantial Chinese investment in every sector. Protection of investment is our responsibility. We have accorded top priority to facilitate Chinese investment in Nepal.
Government of Nepal has announced the year 2020 as Visit Nepal Year. We expect qualitative rise in the number of tourists from our next door neighbour, China.
If a large number of Chinese tourists can make their holidays in faraway lands, why cannot Nepal be made the most favoured destination? Chinese friends will not miss their homes while in Nepal.
We need your cooperation for greater publicity of Nepal as a tourist destination. We welcome investment in tourism infrastructure.
Against this backdrop, I would like to request the Chinese investors to confidently invest in and transfer technology to Nepal and reap the benefit.
Thank you, Xie Xie!

Address by Rt. Hon. President of Nepal on “Promoting Green and Sustainable Development to Implement the UN 2030 Agenda”
Posted onApril 27, 2019April 27, 2019 


Address by Rt. Hon. Mrs. Bidya Devi Bhandari, President of Nepal at a Roundtable on “Promoting Green and Sustainable Development to Implement the UN 2030 Agenda”
Your Excellency President Xi Jinping
Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
At the outset, I would like to extend my sincere thanks to Your Excellency President for your visionary and insightful and remarks at the opening ceremony yesterday.
The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is for the people, for our planet and for prosperity.
This vision is for the kind of development which is transformative, inclusive and equitable. Indeed, sustainable development without inclusivity will be a mere illusion. 
The realization of this ambitious vision is possible only through an enhanced level of co-operation among nations.
It is with this vision that Nepal has embodied the Sustainable Development Goals in its domestic policies, plans and programmes. We are in favor of strengthening the mandate of the United Nations for development.
This is a happy coincidence that the spirit of the Belt and Road Initiative, which aims to achieve development and prosperity leaving no one behind, corresponds with Agenda 2030. 
Belt and Road Initiative, today, is becoming a key driver for poverty alleviation, employment generation, infrastructure building and industrial transformation.
In view of widening financial gap, it will significantly help many countries to implement the Agenda 2030.
The clock of caution is ticking louder when it comes to climate change. Unsustainable patterns of production and consumption have accelerated environmental degradation. Unfortunately, countries like Nepal are bearing the brunt of climate change despite their negligible emissions. Women and underprivileged community have been its main victims. The only way forward is development of green economy. The time has come to review the development models which are detrimental from environmental perspectives. The research findings have indicated that our posterity will not only face uncertainty but their future will be jeopardized if we fail to maintain the ecological balance of the planet. 
Sustainable development under this circumstance will only be an illusion if such a situation is not altered.
In this context, while balancing all the three components of sustainable development, the Belt and Road Initiative can serve as an important medium in transforming to clean-energy and low-carbon pathways of economy.
Similarly, cooperation in emerging industries like information technology can generate substantial growth. 
To minimize the environmental risks, scientific researches and solutions based on them should be sought.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Nepal is a country of the high Himalayas. These high peaks serve as the heat sink during the summer and heat source in winter. Forming an integral part of the organically linked ecosystem, they are common heritage of humanity.
Also, there is tremendous potential in developing clean energy in Nepal through hydropower. It can greatly contribute to the green development of Nepal as well as its neighbours.
It is a matter of happiness that Nepal, which was connected to the southern route of the ancient Silk Road, is now linked with Belt and Road Initiative. We believe that this Initiative will support the process of economic transformation of landlocked Nepal by expanding its connectivity networks and integrating its economy into the global market.
In addition, we expect that Belt and Road Initiative will greatly contribute to eradicating poverty, deepening and expanding trade, revolutionizing industries, creating jobs and improving the living conditions of the people by increasing economic opportunities.
There is a Chinese maxim: “building roads is the first step towards prosperity”. We are now creating the necessary foundations to realize the long-term goal of development and prosperity. In this context, we have laid primary emphasis on the development of Trans-Himalayan Multidimensional Connectivity Network under Belt and Road Initiative.
The objective of “peace and cooperation, openness and inclusiveness, mutual learning and mutual benefit,” which is the spirit of the ancient Silk Road, and embraced by Belt and Road Initiative, will help us realize the SDGs.
Thank you !

Statement delivered by the Rt. Hon. President at the High-Level Meeting of the Second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation
26 April 2019, Beijing
Belt and Road Cooperation: Shaping a Brighter Shared Future
H.E. Xi Jinping, President of the People’s Republic of China,
Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I have brought to you all warm greetings and best wishes from the Government and people of Nepal, the land of Buddha and Sagarmatha, the highest peak on earth.
I would like to express my sincere thanks to H.E. Xi Jinping for the kind invitation to attend this important event and for the warm hospitality accorded to us. I would also like to congratulate the Government and people of China on the occasion of the 70th anniversary of founding of the People’s Republic of China.
The world today is at the cusp of profound transformation. In many parts of the world, poverty has been reduced, access to health and education has become easier, and many economies are heading towards prosperity. The unprecedented scale of technological revolution has opened a vista of possibilities.
Those achievements would have been impossible were it not for cooperation.
Those gains would have been unthinkable were it not for collaboration.
However, the new as well as old challenges are conspicuous. The distribution of wealth is strikingly uneven. Promises of development have not yielded for many. Millions of people are still trapped in the vicious cycle of poverty.
The very foundation of cooperation and collaboration is facing scepticism. Protectionism and isolationist tendencies have surfaced.
Such regressive response will not only jeopardize the hard-earned gains, but also be unjust for future generations.
We have to acknowledge that the existence of poverty in any corner of the world can be a threat to the whole world.
Therefore, proliferation of several challenges calls for more collaboration, not less.
Unfinished pursuit of development calls for more cooperation, not less.
The quest for brighter and better future calls for more connectivity, not less.
Asia is a powerhouse of the world economy. For the future of global prosperity, the region is well poised to play a pivotal role. A region with many rich civilizations, Asia’s future should be that of inclusivity and partnership.
The far-sighted vision of President Xi to build a community of shared future for mankind through Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) carries a huge potential. It is an important framework for collaboration, for cooperation and for connectivity.
Mutual efforts for mutual benefit; inclusive development for fair and equitable world order; and the green development for the good health of the people and planet embody its spirit.
It lays emphasis on boosting connectivity, developing infrastructure, connecting markets and enhancing cooperation among the nations in diverse sectors in the region and beyond.
It promotes openness in place of isolation, cooperation in place of confrontation and win-win cooperation in place of zero-sum game.
Vis-à-vis the huge resource gap in global level, BRI can play an instrumental role in implementing the Sustainable Development Goals.
And, BRI is the engine for prosperous future where not a single country is excluded from the fruit of development.
For a landlocked country like Nepal, connectivity is of paramount importance in its socio-economic development. With enhanced connectivity, vast opportunities for trade, investment, tourism and people-to-people relations will open up.
The development of ‘Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network’, including Nepal-China Cross-Border Railway, will boost connectivity not only between Nepal and China but other countries in the region.
After a prolonged political transition Nepal has achieved political stability. Our objective ahead is to bring about visible transformation in the living standard of our people.
Our national aspiration is guided by the motto ‘Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali’. Our immediate goal is to graduate from LDC status. We intend to become a middle-income country by achieving the Sustainable Development Goals well before 2030.
We would like to enhance bilateral as well as multilateral collaboration and cooperation with neighbours, other friendly countries including development partners to overcome our development challenges.
To conclude, while expressing firm conviction that the Second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation will be successful in building up our concerted efforts for a just, fair, equitable, inclusive and rules-based world order for lasting global peace and prosperity, I would like to express my best wishes for the grand success of this Forum.
Thank you!

Distinguished Guests, and
Ladies and Gentlemen
Namaste, bonjour !
It was five days ago, on 15 April, a ravaging fire caused damage to the Notre-Dame Cathedral, a monument of cultural, architectural and historic importance not only for France and French people but also for the entire world. Words cannot describe the pain of watching the spire of one of the world’s great heritages collapse due to the terrible fire. On behalf of the people and Government of Nepal, I extend my sincere sympathies and solidarities to the French Government and people as they try to cope with this tragedy.
First of all, I would like to thank Ambassador Leger for taking the initiative to organize this event and inviting me to participate in it. I feel honoured to speak a few words in front of you all.
I thank the colleagues both at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the French Embassy for their contributions in the lead up to today’s programme jointly hosted to mark the 70th anniversary of the establishment of Nepal-France relations. Let me also acknowledge the support of Nepal Army, especially their kind gesture to provide this venue for free.
I would also like to thank you all, our distinguished guests, for joining us today. I congratulate and extend my best wishes to all of you on the occasion of the 70th anniversary of our historic relationship.
Dear Friends,
France was the fourth country with which Nepal established its diplomatic relations. It speaks volumes about the importance Nepal attaches to its relations with France.
Yes, Nepal and France are far apart in terms of geographical distance. But, our similarities and common interests are much nobler and higher than this distance. Our countries are home to rich civilizations, cultures and traditions. Mountainous topography and mountaineering culture are deeply linked to our identity. Values of liberty, equality, peace and coexistence underpin our political, social and economic development efforts.
Over the last seven decades, a lot has happened both in Nepal and France. France has achieved a remarkable level of socio-economic development on the foundations of peace, stability and democratic governance. Similarly, in Nepal, though we are yet to achieve the desired level of economic development, our political gains have been both far-reaching and exemplary.
We continue to remain inspired by the development and progress of France. At a time when we have prioritized the socio-economic development of the country on the backdrop of political achievements, we look up to France for a stronger bilateral collaboration and cooperation. In particular, our priority is to enhance economic partnership in the areas of foreign direct investment, trade expansion, tourism linkages and technology transfer.
Dear Friends,
Over the years, Nepal-France relations have evolved into a cooperative and dynamic partnership encompassing political, economic, developmental, cultural and educational spheres.
France is one of the development partners and a reliable friend of Nepal. We remain thankful to the Government and people of France for their support and contribution to Nepal’s economic and social development.
Recently, there has been much progress in terms of our bilateral cooperation. Recent visits by Nepal’s Foreign Secretary to France and French Secretary-General to Nepal have provided a fresh momentum in our relations. Our goodwill Ambassador’s role has also been instrumental towards this end.
I am aware of the significant interests of French companies to invest in Nepal’s infrastructure. This is very much important as we strive to attract foreign direct investment vis-à-vis our motto of ‘Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali’.
France is one of the largest trading partners of Nepal. France stands at the fourth and eighth ranks respectively in the list of Nepal’s import and export destination countries. Our trade linkages have been growing, albeit gradually, also in the context of the preferential access granted to Nepali products by the European Union.
We welcome over 30,000 French tourists to Nepal every year. As we observe 2020 as ‘Visit Nepal Year’, we hope French people will continue to make Nepal their favoured destination and that this number will increase.
Nepal and France also work constructively in multilateral forums including at the United Nations. We believe that France has a crucial role to play, not only in European affairs but also in global issues, in promoting a rules-based international system, preserving multi-lateralism, and pursuing the spirit of Paris Climate Accord.
All these instances we have before us demonstrate an excellent friendship built on the ideals of cooperation, mutual interests and respect towards each other. The statistical figures of our partnership may be small but they provide a strong foundation to work further- as the French proverb rightly says: Petit a petit, l’oiseau fait son nid, which means, ‘little by little, the bird makes its nest’.
Hence, as we observe this important milestone of the 70th anniversary with various programmes, both in Nepal and France, we must not lose sight of the opportunity to consolidate the partnership in all spheres of our relations. Our aim must be to make it a take off point for an enhanced level of engagements with special focus on economic relations.
I believe that, we must utilize this year to bring out the best of our bilateral relations. This may be possible including through the following measures and initiatives:
First and foremost, high-level political contacts are extremely important in strengthening any diplomatic relationship. It has been quite long time since we had an exchange of high-level visits at the political level. The 70th anniversary may be the right occasion for this.
Second, substantive economic component is very much critical for enhancing a bilateral partnership. Further economic engagements in the mutually beneficial areas will be in the interests of both countries.
Third, cultural contacts and people-to-people relations constitute another aspect of our relations. This is nurtured by mutual love and goodwill prevalent at the grassroots level of our societies. Our partnership can prosper only when the public, including the diaspora communities, get engaged.
And, finally, our collaboration at multilateral forums for the global cause of peace, security and development must be strengthened. Given France’s key role in global affairs, we must strengthen our cooperation especially in the areas of development, climate change and peacekeeping, among others.
To conclude, an anniversary is indeed a time to reflect on the contributions, achievements and the past experiences, which make the relationship unique and beautiful. However, we must also remember that an anniversary is not an end-point. It is also an occasion to make a resolve to grow and develop further.
We all know, a single individual alone cannot whistle a symphony. A whole orchestra is needed to play it. For the growth and development of Nepal-France relationship as well, all stakeholders including political leaders, diplomats, civil servants, business communities, civil societies, students, media persons and most importantly the common people have their part to play. Let’s us work collectively towards enhancing the bonds of this long and historic friendship.
I thank you for your attention. And, once again, congratulations and best wishes on the occasion of the 70th anniversary of Nepal-France relations!

Opening and Concluding Remarks delivered as a Chair by Hon. Pradeep Kumar Gyawali, Minister for Foreign Affairs, at the first plenary session: Investment Opportunities in Nepal in “Nepal Investment Summit 2019”, Kathmandu 29 March 2019 
Opening remarks by Chair
Honourable Ministers
Honourable Chief Ministers
Excellencies the Ambassadors
Distinguished Panelists,
Fellow Participants!
I am pretty delighted to welcome you all in the first plenary session of Nepal Investment Summit 2019. At the outset, let me express my sincere appreciation for the opportunity to chair the session. I am highly encouraged by your overwhelming participation in the Summit. I wish your pleasant stay and successful business mission in Nepal.
It is certainly not my intention to reiterate what has been delivered about the subject in the inaugural session a short while ago by the Rt. Honorable Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli and also by the Honorable Finance Minister Dr Yuba Raj Khatiwada. However, I wish to highlight some of the important points that will set the context for our deliberations.
It is often said that this is an era of Asian century. With unprecedented economic dynamism, global development landscape is being changed and locus of global geo-economics is being shifted towards Asia. Our neighbours–China and India have already emerged as global economic powerhouse. With this development in the neighbourhood and Nepal’s strategic location between them have unleashed immense investment and business opportunities in Nepal.
In this context, the recent political developments in Nepal have also presented encouraging environment for that matter. Following the promulgation of new constitution and the conclusion of local, provincial and federal elections, the long-awaited political stability has been achieved in the country with the strong federal government of two-third majority. Political stability, in fact, brings in policy continuity and consistency. Favourable political milieu equally entails a conducive atmosphere for undertaking much-needed socio-economic transformation in the country. In line with this vision, the present Government has set its utmost priority to realize the motto of ‘Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali’. It essentially means leaving not a single Nepali behind and making the entire country rich. In that sense, political stability and economic prosperity complement each other in a virtuous cycle.
Our vision of socio-economic transformation embraces the targets to graduate from LDC status at an early date; to become Middle Income Country and achieve SDGs by 2030. These targets are being taken up by the upcoming five-year plan. The plan also aims to attain double-digit growth to meet these targets. Mobilization of domestic finance alone will not be adequate to achieve these ambitious development goals. Foreign direct investment is, therefore, must. is essential to meet our requirements.
Over the last three decades or so, the country has been pursuing liberal economic policies and competitive market regime. The new constitution has categorically espoused this spirit with the provision of welcoming foreign capital and technological investment in priority sectors. Almost all sectors have been open for foreign investment and the sensitive list for investment is kept very short. Hydropower, agriculture, manufacturing, tourism, infrastructure, ICTs, mines and minerals are some of the promising sectors for investment in Nepal. The labour cost in Nepal is competitive and low. Qualified and skilled workforce is available at reasonable cost.
With a view to creating an enabling environment for domestic and foreign investors in line with the constitutional spirit, the present Government has undertaken a number of policy, legal, institutional and procedural reforms.
On the policy and legal front, many new laws have been made consistent with the new constitution. Recently, the two key legislations, namely Foreign Investment and Technology Transfer Act (FITTA) and Public-Private Partnership and Investment Board Act (PPIBA) have been enacted. The FITTA ensures national treatment for any foreign investment and repatriation of return has been guaranteed. The introduction of automatic route system will facilitate foreign investment-related procedures in a simple and predictable manner. The PPIBA provides one stop service for foreign investment exceeding 6 billion rupees or hydro project over 200 MW capacity.
Governance and rule of law plays an important role in creating environment for making investment and doing business in the country. Needless to say, good governance is a sin qua non for the expansion of economic activities as well as for the attainment of economic prosperity. We have accelerated our crusade against corruption with absolute zero-tolerance policy on it. The introduction of social security system for workers will promote congenial industrial relations and thereby contribute to conducive investment climate.
Nepal offers an attractive tax and export incentive structure to investors. Procedures for land acquisition, company registration, environmental assessment and infrastructure development have been simplified. Online registration and payment system has been put in place.
Connectivity remains critical in making investment decisions and also for smooth business operations. Reliable infrastructure network reduces the cost of doing business. It is the policy of Government to build critical infrastructure. Electricity supply for industries has been made almost 24/7. Major power projects are on the verge of completion. We will soon become power surplus country. Road networks within and beyond border have witnessed much progress. Construction of Kathmandu-Terai Fast Track is moving ahead. One SEZ is in operation and some others are in the pipeline. Digital connectivity also remains under our priority and is under expansion.
Sound management of macroeconomic fundamentals have made investment in Nepal risk-free. Conclusion of BIPPA with friendly countries ensures protection of investment and that of avoidance of double taxation provides investment incentives. The upcoming policy and legal reform in the intellectual property sector will offer more benefits under various multilateral instruments.
We understand that reform is a continuous process. We are committed to it. We will do it with the private sector on board. We will undertake necessary measures to sustain an investment and business-friendly atmosphere in the country.
As I said earlier, Nepal is located between the world’s two largest markets—China and India. Nepal enjoys preferential market access to both with duty-free export facilities for most of its products. Nepal as an LDC enjoys similar preferential arrangements with many developed and developing countries including EU and USA. With rising middle-class population, even the domestic market is expanding. For prospective investors in Nepal, market will not be the problem.
Connectivity tops the agenda in our engagements with neighbours. Port facilities in India have improved. New transit route through inland waterway is being developed. Transit procedures are being simplified through the use of modern technology. Transport Transit arrangement with China will provide us another transit corridor for international trade.
The prospect of regional electricity market is growing. Policy and regulatory framework for power trade is being developed. Cross-border transmission lines are being constructed. The conclusion of MoU on BIMSTEC Grid Interconnection has enlarged the prospect of regional power trade. The MoU on Power Trade between Nepal and Bangladesh has further expanded the power market.
I am glad to share with you that Nepal is resource-rich country with abundant water resources, population dividend, biodiversity, and wonderful landscapes together with trainable workforce and hospitable people. It is a virgin land for lucrative investment. Business profile of multinationals operating in Nepal reveals that none of them have gone bankrupt. They have made handsome return and have contributed huge amount to our treasury.
In a nutshell, investment in Nepal is a profitable venture. Political climate is favorable. Policy, legal and institutional framework is enabling and encouraging. Regional ambience is equally promising. In this context, we call upon and welcome investors to think about investing in industrial venture and business operations in Nepal. This will turn out to a win-win situation for both investors and Nepal.
Concluding Remarks
Distinguished Participants,
Globally, foreign direct investment accounted for two fifths of total foreign financial flows to LDCs in 2018. This is a huge portion of money that matters to our economic development. Therefore, I assure you that our commitments to attract and facilitate foreign direct investment in the best possible business climate will stay the course for decades to come. That is, we will adopt more and more foreign investment friendly policies in the days ahead.
Perhaps I underline that regional business climate is improving both under bilateral and regional frameworks. Thus investing in this country also opens the way for integrating into regional value chains thereby gaining efficiency and sustainable growth of businesses.
As a matter of fact, the scale of foreign investments to date is scanty. But the growth in FDI is impressive as it stands at 26 percent per annum in the last five years. I think this alone is a pointer that business climate in Nepal is improving steadily.
In my capacity as the Foreign Minister of this country, I wish to share you that concluding bilateral investment promotion and protection agreements, double taxation avoidance agreements and participation in regional investment agreements are our top priority. We have already concluded half a dozen BIPPAs, nearly a dozen DTAAs and negotiating regional investment agreements in BIMSTEC and SAARC. I am confident that this will further ameliorate business environment in the days ahead.
Furthermore, I am delighted to inform you that large-scale connectivity projects with neighboring countries India and China including BRI projects are already underway and accordingly we have focused on massive infrastructure developments within the country as well. Thus I believe that investments in these projects will be profitable and completion of these projects further open up new business opportunities and help existing businesses to flourish further.
Currently, we are working on Country-Specific FDI Facilitation Strategies in order to ensure matching potential foreign investors of a particular country and priority investment sectors in Nepal. We are also planning to catalyze building close relationships between research and training institutions in investment sectors. I think this will facilitate win-win investment partnership between host and source countries.
Likewise, we are well-poised to mobilize all our missions across the globe to facilitate foreign investment through essential services to investors: they include quick responding to inquiry and information seekers, solving problems, facilitation of first-time country visits for investment purposes and after-care services throughout investment cycle.
At this juncture, it is pertinent to realize the indispensable role of NRNs that have been a succor in almost every sphere of national life since some decades. I fondly recall the NRN Global Knowledge Conference held last year, which provided us with inputs on how to best utilize their knowledge, skills, capital and experiences. I appeal NRNs to come forward more vehemently.
It is true that foreign investors sometimes roll back or retract their decisions due to some uncertain local factors. But, we have the greatest resources to our rescue. Nepali Disapora abroad, which is around 5 million, has their steering committee in about 80 countries. I would like to sincerely recommend all foreign investors not to flinch back but find an NRN partner who aids you to cut across any hurdle at local level. So, I appeal both NRNs and foreign investors to come forward in partnership or separately whichever way suits you best.
I hope this summit helps you in tapping the best business opportunities in Nepal and it will be a huge success for us and for you all equally. Do believe that we highly value your insightful and pragmatic comments and suggestions to chart our future course.
Finally, I want to commit before you that we will also hold bilateral investment meetings through our embassies as and when necessary. I am confident that we will have continuous engagements in the coming days.
Once again, I heartily thank you all for your active participation, keen attention, and invaluable contributions to this plenary session.

Statement delivered by Hon. Pradeep Kumar Gyawali, Minister for Foreign Affairs, at the Second High-Level United Nations Conference on South-South Cooperation 
Buenos Aires, Argentina, 20 March 2019
Mr. President,
Excellencies, Heads of State/Government and ministers
Distinguished delegates
Ladies and gentlemen.
It is my honour and privilege to participate in the Second High-Level United Nations Conference on South-South Cooperation in the beautiful city of Buenos Aires, which is witness of the important and historic Buenos Aires Plan of Action (BAPA) adopted here 40 years ago. The BAPA Conference in 1978 not only set a bedrock for cooperation among developing countries but also became a synonymous with South-South Cooperation itself.
I would like to join the speakers before me in thanking and appreciating the generosity of the Government of Argentina for hosting as well as for making excellent arrangements for the Conference. We also appreciate the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the UN Office for South-South Cooperation for substantive as well as other preparations.
I also take this opportunity to congratulate you, Mr. President, and other officers on your appointment to lead this important Conference. I would also like to assure you of our full support in discharging your important responsibilities.
I align my statement with the statement of the Group of 77 and China delivered by the State of Palestine.
Mr. President,
South-South Cooperation is more relevant now than ever before.
The development landscape has changed significantly. The South has developed an enormous potential for economic transformation. The progress some members of the South have achieved over the decades has not only widened the scope of the cooperation, but has brought us closer towards realizing the purpose of ‘collective self-reliance’. While sharing of experiences and best practices between and among the countries of the South will go a long way, the cooperation needs a more concrete and meaningful form.
This is time to further diversify and strengthen our cooperation: in scale, in scope, in quality and in its effectiveness.
South-South Cooperation, as complementary to and not as a substitute for the North-South Cooperation, plays an important role for the effective and timely implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and other internationally agreed development outcomes such as IPOA and VPOA.
Mr. President,
Let me highlight what cooperation means to a landlocked LDC like Nepal that has just begun an economic transformation to sustain its successful political gains that culminated in the democratic Constitution in 2015. To realize the ambition of the Constitution, the Government has already initiated transformative process in a holistic approach with a resolve of   “Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali”. 41 percent women representations in the federal, provincial and local elected bodies, introduction of Comprehensive Social Security Program, Nationwide Health Insurance Program and Prime Minister Employment Program among others, are the instruments to achieve prosperity and happiness. We have internalized the SDGs in our national policies and planning. We wish to graduate from LDC stage at earliest and to become middle income country by 2030. There is need of enhanced level of investment to accelerate the economic growth which demands scaled up international cooperation.
We know that those who have a long journey to travel should walk fast. And we are prepared to walk fast and catch up with fast growing economy.
But we are not alone in this journey. We are confident that international cooperation and partnership, including South-South cooperation, are important components in realizing our national development goals and objectives.
Mr. President,
Lastly, allow me now to highlight four important principles for my country:

First, some members in the South despite being similar development ambitions are far lagging behind. They need even more understanding, partnership and cooperation. Principle of ‘leaving no one behind’ should be placed at the core.


Second, our cooperation should have a focus, a clear focus on poverty eradication. SDG 1 is the biggest battle we have and perhaps the most cross-cutting, and therefore a sine qua non for making the world a better place to live.


Third, gender equality, inclusiveness, concrete steps to mitigate the adverse effect of climate change and the social justice, among others, should be the guide posts of development perspectives. Women and youths should be assured for better opportunities and more investment must be guaranteed in education and technological innovations.


Finally, our development experience tells that all forms of cooperation should respect national ownership and leadership, and focus on country needs and priorities. And global peace and stability is the prerequisite, because cost of conflicts mainly goes on the shoulder of Global South.

To conclude, Mr. President, I reiterate Nepal’s call for meeting commitments, forging partnerships, increasing cooperation and redoubling our efforts, including through the South-South Cooperation, to support the countries that need the most. Nepal is ready to work together with all fellow member states and all stakeholders to this important end.
I thank you.

Statement by Honourable Mr. Pradeep Kumar Gyawali Minister for Foreign Affairs of Nepal and Head of Delegation to the High-Level Segment of the 40th Session of Human Rights Council Geneva, 27 February 2019
Mr. President
Excellencies
Distinguished Delegates
Ladies and Gentlemen
It is indeed an honour to be back after 11 years since I first addressed this Council in 2007.
I bring warm greetings on behalf of the people and Government of Nepal for the success of this session.
At the outset, let me begin by congratulating you, Mr. President, and members of the Bureau and assure Nepal’s full support.
I congratulate Madam High Commissioner and wish her for a successful tenure of office.
Mr. President,
While addressing the 73rd session of the UNGA last September, the Prime Minister of Nepal Rt. Honourable Mr. K P Sharma Oli had said and I quote, “”[W]e hold the view that development, democracy and respect for human rights are interdependent and mutually reinforcing. As a member of the Human Rights Council, we will continue to play our constructive role to deliver on Council’s mandates.” Unquote.
This statement essentially reflects Nepal’s firm commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights at home and constructively contribute to fulfill the mandate of this Council as its member.
We believe in multilateralism with the United Nations at its center. Nepal holds strong faith in the principles and values enshrined in the UN Charter, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other human rights instruments to which we are a party.
We firmly believe in the universality, indivisibility, interrelatedness, interdependence and mutually reinforcing nature of human rights, including the right to development. All human rights must be treated in a fair and equal manner on the same footing and with the same emphasis. Our approach must remain balanced and all human rights must be operational at national, regional and international levels. The rule of law must work at all levels.
Peace and human rights cannot be achieved without attaining inclusive development. We consider that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and Global Compact on Migration provide wider platforms to advance inclusive human rights agenda everywhere. Faithful implementation of these landmark compacts and other relevant internationally agreed development frameworks is central to the enjoyment of human rights by all.
As we celebrate the centenary of International Labour Organization and the 30th anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, these milestone events should inspire us to further advance human-centered future of work and the human rights agenda.
Mr. President,
The Human Rights Council and its mechanisms have been playing an important role for the protection and promotion of human rights. The work of this Council should rekindle a hope for all those that look upon us as a voice of conscience. This becomes possible only when we act in unison for all those that deserve our attention. Our commitment and action should speak in harmony.
The Universal Periodic Review mechanism has successfully evolved as a platform of positive international cooperation in the field of human rights. This represents a transparent and fair process for all. We consider that the spirit of cooperation and desire to improve human rights situation everywhere through UPR process should be further promoted. In Nepal, we have been implementing the outcome of second cycle of UPR in earnest under a clear plan of actions.
Mr. President,
Nepal represents a uniquely successful case of democratic political transformation. At the center of this process lies our aspiration to ensure equal rights to all of our people.
Therefore, Nepal’s commitment to the universal values of human rights is total. We are a party to all major international human rights instruments, including seven of the nine core human rights conventions. We have internalized those values into our national laws, policies and practices.
The Constitution of Nepal is founded on universally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms and such other principles as inclusive multiparty democratic polity, pluralism, the rule of law, representative and accountable government, social justice and independent judiciary. Equality and non-discrimination lie at the core of it. The Constitution guarantees special measures that all sections of our society are enabled to enjoy those rights and receive fair share of representation in all spheres of national life, including politics, governance, health, education, employment and social security.
We have put in place requisite legal and institutional arrangements to realize those provisions. The year 2018 essentially remained a year of human rights law making. We accomplished the task of enacting total 16 legislations for the implementation of all fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution.
The National Human Rights Commission of Nepal confirms to the Paris principle and stands accredited as ‘A’ category national human rights institution for years.
Separate independent and constitutionally empowered Commissions have been established to promote and protect the rights and interests of women, Dalit, indigenous nationalities, Madheshi, Tharu and Muslims. National Inclusion Commission is mandated to ensure that the constitutional and legal provisions are effectively implemented.
True to our commitment, we have all along remained constructively engaged with the UN human rights mechanisms and fulfilled our reporting obligations. Last year alone, three periodic reports of Nepal under CRPD, CERD and CEDAW were considered by the respective treaty bodies. We hosted Special Rapporteur on the Human Rights of Migrants and Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women, Its Causes and Consequences. We have extended invitation to the Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food and are keen on welcoming her to Nepal some time this year.
Nepal was one of the pioneering countries to mainstreaming human rights agendas into national policies and plans through Human Rights National Action Plan. Currently the fourth series of the Action Plan (2014-19) is under implementation and the fifth one is being prepared in tandem with the national development plan for next five years.
Mr. President,
Having firmly set the political course in place, we are resolutely focused on economic agenda with the long term vision of “Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali”. We are in the mission of enabling our people to fully enjoy all human rights. Landmark schemes of contribution-based social security scheme, universal health insurance program and Prime Minister Employment Program have been launched.
Forty-five percent of the public sector employment has been reserved for weaker sections of our population. The policy of affirmative action has significantly enhanced their access to education, health services, employment opportunities and political participation. We have been able to bring transformative change in their empowerment and bring them to the forefront of political and development process.
The story of gender equality and empowerment is particularly inspiring. Women now represent 33 per cent at the federal and provincial assemblies, and total 41% in all elected bodies. Nepal currently has a woman Head of State.
Strengthening of national capacity remains our priority. Nepal’s independent judiciary has made contribution to further enrich human rights jurisprudence. We have abolished death penalty and do not condone impunity.
Nepal is a uniquely successful case of nationally owned and nationally led peace process. To conclude the last leg of this process, term of the two independent Commissions- the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons- have been recently extended to allow time to complete their mandates. We are preparing for the amendment of the laws in consultation with and participation of the victims. There exists a requisite political will to conclude this last remaining task of the peace process in equally unique way. In doing so, we will be guided by the Comprehensive Peace Accord, directive of the Supreme Court, relevant international commitments, concerns of the victims and the ground realities. There will be no blanket amnesty in the cases of serious violations of human rights.
Civil society organizations have been important partners in our development efforts. We value the role of the media and civil society in the promotion and protection of human rights.
To conclude, Mr. President, Nepal truly believes that together we can provide a strong voice to all those who look up to the Council and make a positive difference in their lives by upholding the mantle of human rights.
We are a young democracy. We are keen to learn from the wider world, share our own experience in the field, and contribute for the promotion and protection of human rights. Our experience so far in the Council has given much needed confidence to consolidate democracy, peace and human rights in the country. With this in mind, Nepal has presented candidature for the re-election to the Council for the second term 2021-2023 and we count on your support and cooperation.
We know that no country has ever achieved perfection in human rights. What is important is how sincerely and seriously we are aiming higher and better. We consider that Nepal has been consistently doing better and we are genuinely willing to improve further. With this open mind and genuine desire we have come to this session.
I thank you.

Remarks by the Minister for Foreign Affairs Hon. Mr. Pradeep Kumar Gyawali at the 71st Anniversary Programme of Nepal Council of World Affairs
Posted onFebruary 18, 2019 

Kathmandu, 18th February 2019
Chairman and the Office Bearers of Nepal Council of World Affairs,
Excellencies,
Distinguished Participants,
Friends from the media,
Ladies and Gentlemen.
Namaste and a very good afternoon.
At the outset, let me thank Nepal Council of World Affairs for inviting me to this important event organized to mark its 71st Anniversary.
I wish to congratulate the Council and its office bearers on their successful marching the journey of seven decades and extend my best wishes for the continued progress of the Council. I commend Council’s efforts to provide a forum for dialogues and discourse in the domain of foreign policy.
Since its inception, the Council was active to host luminaries in foreign policy and diplomacy from within the country and abroad. I wish that the Council will be able to carry on this tradition of quality deliberations, revive the vibrancy of its membership, and generate a community of foreign policy experts.
This would be a fitting service to the objectives of this Council.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Nepali people are proud of their independent history and sovereignty. The Constitution of Nepal has clearly defined the areas of national interest and provided broad policy framework for the conduct of independent foreign policy. Principles of Panchasheel, non-alignment, UN Charter, international law and norms of world peace have remained guiding principles for our foreign relations.
Our foreign policy aims at safeguarding sovereignty, territorial integrity, independence and protection of national interest. Within this framework, promoting Nepal’s credentials as an open and progressive democratic State at the international level; and pursuit of effective economic diplomacy to the service of overarching objective of “Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali” remain twin goals of our external engagements.
Amity with all and enmity with none is the motto in managing our international relations. We value equality, justice, respect and mutual benefit in the conduct of foreign relations.
Building on the hard earned political stability, Nepal at present strives to achieve economic development and prosperity. The present Government is committed to bring economic transformation of the country and improve quality of life of the people. We have mobilized our diplomatic apparatus to pursue these objectives by promoting foreign direct investment, tourism, technology transfer, and export trade. We are equally striving for consolidating inclusive democracy and ensuring good governance. Our unflinching commitment to human rights and fundamental freedoms will be stronger with political and economic empowerment of the people.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
We enjoy cordial and friendly relations with our neighbors. We have further strengthened trust, goodwill and expanded the scope of cooperation and economic partnership with our two immediate neighbors. In addition to the regular exchange of high level visits, increasing people to people contacts have further strengthened and deepened our relations.
Nepal and India enjoy civilizational, geographical, socio-economic, and cultural relations. The visits of the Right Honorable Prime Minister to India and the visits of His Excellency the Prime Minister of India to Nepal twice last year have contributed to further enhance mutual trust and consolidate bilateral relations. 
Nepal and China are age old friends. Our relations as they are based on the principle of peaceful co-existence have always remained friendly and cordial. The visits of Right Honorable Vice President and Right Honorable Prime Minister to China last year have further consolidated the bilateral relations.
Equally important is our relation with the friendly countries in our extended neighborhood, the labour receiving countries and the other countries in the comity of nations. We attach high importance to our relations with the major powers and permanent members of the UN Security Council, the European Union and its member States, and our traditional development partners.
Considering the importance of establishing formal relations with UN member states, we have steadily expanded our diplomatic outreach to 163 countries.
Dear Friends,
We believe in regionalism as a vehicle for trade and economic growth. Last year, we successfully hosted fourth BIMSTEC summit in Kathmandu. We are the Chair of SAARC and have consistently worked to revive the stalled SAARC process. Last year in September we hosted informal meeting of SAARC Council of Ministers in New York on the sidelines of the UNGA. We are a member of Asian Cooperation Dialogue and a dialogue partner of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization.
We believe in constructive multilateralism to serve our collective interests. Nepal remains actively engaged in the multilateral forums. Our faith in the principles and purposes of the UN Charter is unwavering. We consider United Nations as the centre of multilateralism to deliberate on global issues of common concerns. We do not see contradiction in multilateralism and national interests and are committed to a rules-based multilateral trading system with the WTO at its core.
We understand the multilateral rules and architecture are not perfect and they must be made fit-for-purpose to deliver on the global agenda including the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda. Therefore, we stand for timely and comprehensive reform of the United Nations for global peace, accountability and effective service delivery in view of the burgeoning global problems and dwindling resources. We hold that the reform of the Security Council should reflect the emerging realities and embrace democratic principles and fair representation.
Over six decades of Nepal’s exemplary participation in the UN mandated peace operations have been widely acknowledged. Currently, Nepal stands 5th largest troop and police contributing country to the UN peace operations. Considering Nepal’s contribution to the maintenance of international peace and security, Nepal has been elected as the member of the Organizational Committee of the Peace Building Commission for the term of 2019-2020. Nepali peacekeepers have proven their competence as highly professional and dedicated savior of peace and humanitarian protection.
We continue to maintain principled and independent position on major issues of global concern. We support general and complete disarmament, especially of all weapons of mass destruction. We condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. We support peaceful settlement of all international disputes and consider diplomacy and dialogue as the most legitimate means of reducing differences and resolving conflicts.
Currently Nepal is a member of the Human Rights Council. We have presented our candidature for re-election to the Human Rights Council for the term of 2020-22. As a state party to 24 human rights related international instruments, including 7 out of 9 core human rights conventions, Nepal always stands for apolitical examination of human rights issues. We continue to faithfully engage with the relevant UN human rights mechanisms such as the UPR process, the Special Procedures mechanism and treaty bodies. Our commitment to human rights and fundamental freedom is total and we are committed to fulfill our human rights obligations in good faith.
Though we are not a party to the Refugee Convention and its Protocol, we have hosted Bhutanese refugees on humanitarian grounds. They have the right to return to their home country in safety and honor and this must be respected.
Nepal firmly stands for the implementation of the Paris Accord on Climate Change. Right Honorable President’s representation to the COP 24 reflects the high importance attached by Nepal on this critical issue of our time. Climate vulnerabilities of the countries like ours is real and we call for international community’s substantial support in terms of climate finance and technology for adaptation and mitigation.
Nepal remains steadfast in its call for the effective implementation of all relevant international agreements to address the specific development needs of LDCs and LLDCs. We call for progress in the stalled process of Doha Round of trade negotiations and implementation of earlier decision on special and differentiated treatment to the LDCs and LLDCs in particular.
Safety, security and well being of our migrant workers remain an area of vital interest for us.  We have been closely working with the countries of origin and destination through bilateral and multilateral processes. Currently Nepal is the Chair of the Colombo Process, a regional process of labour sending Asian countries. We hosted the Fifth Senior Officials’ Meeting and Sixth Ministerial Consultation of the Colombo Process in November last year.
Nepal constructively contributed during the negotiation of the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration and was represented at Ministerial level in the Intergovernmental Conference to Adopt the Compact in Marrakesh in December last year. Nepal’s emphasis on decent work, ethical recruitment, welfare of migrants including female workers, consular support and cooperation found good space in the compact.
To conclude, ladies and gentlemen, let me emphasize that the mainstay of today’s diplomacy is the pursuit of economic agenda. We will strive to promote our vital economic interests through activities aimed at attracting more foreign investment in our national priority sectors, expanding our export trade and promoting tourism, among others. We will strive to widen the avenues of cooperation with our neighbors in conformity with our national interest and priorities.
Consistent with domestic and external realities, we continue to follow the unfolding opportunities and try to benefit from them by readjusting our strategies as appropriate.
The enormous international goodwill towards Nepal and Nepali people, ever expanding Nepali diaspora, our culture, civilizational heritage make our soft power. We will continue to harness existing soft power and build on its strengths for the long term benefit of the country and the people.
I thank you for your kind attention.

Remarks by Minister for Foreign Affairs Hon. Mr. Pradeep Kumar Gyawali at the Kantipur Conclave Kathmandu, 18 February 2019
Posted onFebruary 18, 2019 

Theme: “Nepal in the World Stage”.
Honourable Minister for Finance,
Mr. Moderator,
Excellences,
Friends from Media,
Ladies and gentlemen.
At the outset, let me thank the Kantipur Media Group for inviting me to this conclave and for the opportunity to share my thoughts.
I willconfine myself on the given theme- Nepal in the World Stage and dwell upon foreign policy and diplomacy- especially on how we are promoting national interests in bilateral, regional and multilateral spheres.
For that, let me begin by a quote from the address to the nation by the Right Honourable Prime Minister Mr. K P Sharma Oli a few days ago on the completion of one year in office by the present Government.
I quote:
“Nepal has improved its foreign relations in the spirit of ‘amity with all, enmity with none’. Nepal has demonstrated balanced foreign policy while maintaining visible presence in global affairs. It is a matter of satisfaction [that] Nepal’s voice is being heard in regional and international forums. Attraction, appreciation and confidence of the global community towards Nepal has grown.”
Unquote.
This statement by the Prime Minister succinctly captures the present state of Nepal in the world stage.
Now, let me briefly outline how this has been so and how we intend to further consolidate our foreign relations to the service of Nepal’s core national interests.
The Constitution of Nepal provides guiding framework for the conduct of our foreign policy and international relations. Our foreign policy aims at safeguarding sovereignty, territorial integrity, independence and protection of national interest. Within this framework, promoting Nepal’s credentials as an open and progressive democratic State at the international level; and pursuit of effective economic diplomacy to the service of overarching objective of “prosperous Nepal and happy Nepali” remain twin goals of our external engagements.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
As you all know, Nepal began to open up to the outer world only after 1950. Our place in the global stage therefore represents the achievements of our foreign relations thereafter.
The journey so far has been characterized by the expansion of bilateral relations, expansion of trade, commerce and economic relations, acquiring membership of most of the multilateral organizations, including the United Nations, championing of regionalism, adherence to the principles of UN Charter, non-alignment and strong commitment to international law and norms of world peace.
This has enabled us to take independent posture on international issues, articulate our views on merit basis, contribute to the world peace, and nurture friendship with all countries of the world on the basis of sovereign equality.
Having said that, let me touch upon where we stand today.
We have maintained harmonious and friendly relationship with both of our immediate neighbours.
The Right Honourable Prime Minister’s official visit to India and the official visit of Indian Prime Minister to Nepal twice last year have elevated the relations to newer heights. Pending issues are being addressed in a spirit of mutual cooperation and friendship. Implementation of development projects under India’s cooperation has gained momentum. We have agreed to increasing cooperation in agriculture, railways and cross-border waterways and they have already been taken up with priority. The scope of development cooperation has been expanded manifold.
During the Prime Minister’s visit to China, 14 various MoUs and Agreements were signed on cooperation in projects related to railways, road and energy sector. We have agreed to intensify implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding on Cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative to enhance connectivity, encompassing such vital components as ports, roads, railways, aviation and communications within the overarching framework of Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network. With the agreement on the text of the Transport Transit Protocol, door has been opened for Nepal to use roads and ports of China for access to and from the sea.
Exchange of visits with our immediate neighbours in my capacity as Foreign Minister and existence of strong relationship and contacts between the governments and people at different layers have further consolidated our age old ties with them.
As much as our relation with our immediate neighbours is important politically, we consider them as combination of opportunities to benefit from their unprecedented economic transformation, and source of trade, tourism and investment.
Our relations with the countries in extended neighbourhood are nurtured by growing cultural and traditional ties. We have intensified exchange of high level visits andare striving to diversify our engagements in the areas of trade, investment, tourism and people-to-people exchanges. The Presidents of Sri Lanka and Myanmar, the Prime Ministers of Bangladesh, Pakistan, Cambodia and Thailand, and State Councilor of Myanmar visited Nepal last year alone.
Our relations with the labour receiving countries have become substantial by the presence of significant number of Nepali migrant workers, exchange of high level visits, and steadily growing trade and investment. The Right Honourable President paid official visit to Qatar last year and UAE the previous year. Nepali migrant workers in the Gulf and South East Asian countries have been a major source of remittances that account a sizeable source of national income. They have also significantly contributed for the economic development of the destination countries and serve as a bridging bond of exchange and friendship.
Our relationship with major powers and development partners have remained cordial and friendly. Exchange of bilateral visits with these countries continue to grow. The Prime Minister had bilateral meetings with the President of Switzerland, Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom and Canada on the sidelines of 73rdUNGA. Prime Minister Right Honourable Mr. K P Sharma Oli visited Costa Rica and held bilateral meeting with the President there.
In my capacity as Foreign Minister, I visited Belgium, Luxembourg, Austria and Portugal, and renewed our partnership with the European Union. I also visited Japan and my Japanese counterpart paid return visit to Nepal immediately after that. My visit to the United States of America and meeting with my counterpart provided opportunity for high level political contacts between the two countries after many years. In all of those visits we have been able to renew, nurture and consolidate bilateral relations, understand each other’s concerns and interests, and expand mutually beneficial agendas of economic cooperation.
Foreign Secretary’s visit to France to participate in the Paris Peace Forum in November and French Secretary-General’s return visit to Nepal last month represented the high-level contact between the two foreign ministries in many years.
Last year alone, we held bilateral political consultations and meetings with China, United States of America, United Kingdom, Switzerland, Republic of Korea, Myanmar, Australia, Canada, France, Mongolia and Poland.
On the multilateral front, Nepal has been an active member of the United Nations since 1955. Nepal’s contribution to the maintenance of world peace through participation in the UN peace operations for over 60 years has been widely acclaimed. Currently, Nepal stands as the 5th largest troop and police contributing country. Nepal has served in the UN Security Council twice.
At present, Nepal is a member of UN Human Rights Council, coordinator for Asia Pacific region in the Human Rights Council, member of UN Peace Building Commission, Deputy Member of the ILO Governing Body, Chair of Committee on Conference, member of UNICEF Executive Board, member of Executive Board of UN-WOMEN, member of Commission on Science and Technology for Development, coordinator of Colombo Process Countries, focal point for trade facilitation in the Group of Least Developed Countries in WTO, vice-chair of UN Disarmament Commission, and a Nepali expert is serving as a member of CEDAW Committee.
We are a state party to twenty-four international human rights related instruments, including seven out of nine core Conventions.Nepal considers all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent, interrelated and mutually reinforcing. Nepal has maintained consistent and dignified position on the issues of world peace and disarmament of all weapons of mass destruction. Nepal’s commitment to human rights, sustainable development, multilateralism and rule-based international order is widely acknowledged.
Nepal continues to champion the cause of LDCs, LLDCs, South-South and Triangular Cooperation in the UN and other international forums. Nepal was the coordinator during the 4th UN Conference on LDCs held in Istanbul. We continue to champion the rights of LLDCs and are a founding member of the International Think Tank for LLDCs.
The Right Honourable President’s representation to the 24th Conference of State Parties of UNFCCC reflects Nepal’s commitment to address climate change and priority accorded by the Government to this critical issue of our time.
Prime Minister Right Honourable Mr. K P Sharma Oli addressed the 73rd United Nations General Assembly in September last year and articulated Nepal’s views on disarmament, world peace, international security, human rights and sustainable development, among others.
Nepal became a party to the International Agreement establishing the UN University for Peace in San Jose last year. Prime Minister Right Honourable Mr. K P Sharma Oli addressed the university during his visit to Costa Rica and the university conferred honorary doctorate on him.
Invitation to Nepal’s Prime Minister to participate in the Annual meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland for the first time since its establishment 50 years ago represents a recognition of the increasing profile of Nepal. Prime Minister’s address to the important panels of WEF and exchange of views with the world leaders in Davos greatly enhanced Nepal’s international standing.
On regional front, Nepal chaired and successfully hosted fourth BIMSTEC summit in Kathmandu last year. We are the Chair of SAARC and have consistently worked to revive the stalled SAARC process. Last year in September we hosted informal meeting of SAARC Council of Ministers in New York. We are a member of Asian Cooperation Dialogue and a dialogue partner of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization.
Having established diplomatic relations with 163 countries, our diplomatic outreach is widening. Currently we maintain 30 Embassies, 3 Permanent Missions, 6 Consulates General and 71 Honorary Consuls to serve our national interest across the globe.
Nepal gathered considerable international attention during the conflict period and the political transition that followed. We are considered as one of the rare success stories of the peace process. We have now emerged a confident democratic nation fully capable of taking forward economic development and prosperity agenda for the benefit of our people. Poverty remains a scar in Nepal’s collective conscience and we intend to erase it at the earliest and utilize our demographic dividend for our own development. Nepal aims to graduate from the LDC status at an early date and become a middle income country by 2030. For that, we remain fully committed to implement SDGs to meet the targets ahead of the stipulated timeframe.
More recently, another dimension of Nepal’s standing in global stage has been added by expanding Nepali diaspora. A number of Nepali nationals have risen to senior positions in the UN and other international organizations. A number of Nepali diasporas have excelled in the field of academics, science and technology, medicine, engineering, arts, designs, architecture, culinary skills, literature, industries, sports and adventures. Many of them have been successful entrepreneurs in different corners of the world and have attained significant progress in their respective fields. They have individually and collectively contributed to the signing of Nepal’s image in the world stage.
Nepal is also known for its natural beauty, adventure sports, ancient arts, architecture, culture, and for the hospitality and warmth of its people. There exists enormous goodwill towards Nepal and Nepali people.
Together, they make important soft power for Nepal.
In sum, Nepal’s standing in the world stage presents an encouraging trajectory. Nepal aspires to attain a decent level of economic development and further enhance its international standing as a progressive, democratic and equitable society. In its international relations Nepal will continue to stand for justice, equality and mutual benefit among the countries.
I thank you all for your attention.
Thank you!

Remarks by The Hon’ble Pradeep Kumar Gyawali, Minister for Foreign Affairs, at a Seminar on “Nepal-India Relations: Issues, Emerging Trends and Boosting Cooperation” organized by the Asian Institute of Diplomacy and International Affairs (AIDIA)
Kathmandu, 17 February 2019
CEO/Founder of Asian Institute of Diplomacy and International Affairs Mr. Sunil K.C.,
Former Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Mr. Bimalendra Nidhi,
Ambassador of India to Nepal, H. E. Mr. Manjeev Singh Puri,
Ambassador-designate of Nepal to India Mr. Nilambar Acharya,
Distinguished participants,
Ladies and Gentlemen:
I thank Mr. Sunil K.C., CEO/Founder of the Asian Institute of Diplomacy and International Affairs, for organizing this seminar and inviting me to speak. I found the theme of the seminar, “Nepal-India Relations: Issues, Emerging Trends and Boosting Cooperation” highly relevant. I am sure that the deliberations during this seminar would be helpful in generating insights into the ways for further enhancing cooperation between our two countries.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Needn’t to say, Nepal and India enjoy a cordial and friendly relationship. Our relations are age-old, time tested, comprehensive, deep and extensive. Linkages of history, culture, tradition and religion have further nurtured our relations. Social and economic lives of our peoples are interlinked. A firm commitment to the principles of peaceful coexistence, sovereign equality, mutual respect and understanding of each other’s aspirations and sensitivities characterize our relations.
Regular exchanges, both at high political level and at the people-to-people level, reflect the depth of our relations and form the very foundation of our engagements in diverse fields.
We remain thankful for India’s generous support and cooperation in our development efforts over the decades. India’s cooperation in infrastructure development and human resource development among others has been helpful in achieving socio-economic transformation of the country.
Our two countries hold tremendous potential of enhancing cooperation in diverse sectors. Long historical bonds, interdependency in diverse sectors and desire of the people of both side ask us to establish a broader collaboration and common efforts in our development journey. However, the immense natural resources that we have been gifted with have not yet been properly harnessed. Economic interlinkages are yet to be consolidated. We are yet to benefit fully from mutual complementarity in many other areas. We need to make further efforts for a meaningful partnership so as to ensure mutually beneficial outcomes.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Talking about the national context of Nepal, I would like to share with you that our whole focus is on translating the present Government’s motto of ‘Prosperous Nepal and Happy Nepali’ into reality. In order to realize this, we strive to achieve socio-economic development and prosperity, building on the dividend of political transformation.
However, we will need huge financial resources including foreign investment in productive sectors in our quest. I am happy to mention here that we are hosting an International Investment Summit on 29-30 March this year to invite foreign investors to Nepal. Our full efforts are currently focused on ensuring a predictable, secure and attractive investment climate in Nepal. In this context, we invite Indian investors to participate in the Summit as well as to make substantial investment in Nepal. If worked properly, we can establish a vivid and wide-range production, supply and value chains in the interest of both side.
Tourism is on of the most important area of bilateral cooperation. Having the shared the cultural and social traditions, values and way of life, both countries can be benefitted by tourism. There are a number of cultural and religious sites common to our people in both countries. Promotion of linkages between Hindu and Buddhist heritage sites in the two countries would be important to further consolidate cultural bonds as well as to promote tourism.
This holds more significance as we continue to promote tourism as a vital sector to contribute to our economic growth. As Nepal is observing 2020 as Visit Nepal Year with a target of welcoming two million tourists, meaningful engagement between the public and private sectors of our two countries would be vital.
Nepal and India can generate more benefits by promoting robust economic partnership. India has been making speedy progress in advancing its economy. We look forward to a strong partnership with India for the transformation of our economy to sustain our drive of economic prosperity.
Nepal and India share the collaborative platforms in various regional and sub-regional forums. Our countries have vital role in the SAARC and BIMSTEC. In the pursuits of regional development, we are engaged closely in these forums. BBIN initiative provides yet another important platform for sub-regional collaboration. As South Asia is the least integrated region despite of huge natural and Human Resources, it is in the interest of both countries to promote regional cooperation, collaboration and joint efforts to face the common challenges.
Technology is the key to innovation and transformation. India, equipped with the modern technology, has established itself as a leading force in driving development. Nepal also aspires to benefit from India’s technological expertise and innovation. Transfer of knowledge and technology will enable us to accelerate the pace of economic development.
Infrastructure development remains a priority of our partnership. Socio-economic development cannot advance in the absence of adequate infrastructure. Geographical proximity and open border offer us an opportunity to develop connectivity in all forms – road, rail, water and air. I am pleased to recall that our two countries are working seriously towards developing cross-border railways, roadways, inland water ways, airways and electrical grid connectivity to promote trade, tourism and investment. Latest understandings in these sectors are encouraging.
Hydropower development is the area that promises great opportunities for collaboration. We have not been able to fully exploit our huge water resources potential despite the pressing need of energy in both countries. We need investment and technology as well as free access to power markets to move forward.
Trade and transit are vital components of Nepal-India bilateral relations. India is our top trading partner in terms of both export and import while Nepal is among India’s top twenty export destinations. A matter of concern in this regard is Nepal’s growing trade deficit, which we must address for our trade to create a win-win scenario. We need more trade facilitation measures, including removal of all barriers. Both sides need to expedite early conclusion of the ongoing comprehensive review of the bilateral Trade Treaty.
Our two countries are endowed with resources, we need are innovative ways and means to harness these resources for economic growth and development for mutual benefit. Development should be the important pillar of our relations in the present context.
India’s achievements in economic fronts are remarkable. It has built infrastructure, developed manufacturing, excelled in services trade, expanded export base and increased agricultural productivity. As India progresses, we see in that an abounding opportunity to benefit. A stable and prosperous Nepal is equally beneficial to India as well.
Adverse effects of climate change can be felt everywhere and widely. It has posed a serious threat to the lives of millions people both side. It is a challenge which can faced only by collaborative efforts. Despite of tremendous achievements in the science, technology and innovations, millions people are still deprived and facing poverty. This is the problem which can be finally triumphed only by collective measures. Terrorism still poses a serious challenge against the humanity, and its black shadows is still roaming in this region. It too warrants the common and coordinating resolve. In the nutshell, our relation requires a higher level of collaboration and partnership.
While speaking about the relations that we would like to see in the context of the 21st century, I would like to fondly recall the exchange of visits by the Prime Ministers of Nepal and India in April and May last year which has generated a new dynamism in our bilateral relations. Our two sides are committed to taking bilateral relations to newer heights by strengthening ongoing cooperation in diverse spheres as well as to expanding partnership on the basis of the principles of equality, mutual trust, respect and mutual benefit. While focusing on effective implementation of all the past agreements and understandings, both sides have intensified engagement for addressing the outstanding matters with the objective of advancing cooperation in all areas.
In view of such focused attention from both sides on enhancing engagements in the areas of common interest, we look forward to a mutually beneficial outcome in coming days. Nepal aims at further deepening its cooperation with its immediate neighbour- India with particular focus on advancing economic partnership.
I conclude by thanking once again AIDIA for organizing this seminar and for this opportunity to share my observations. I wish this event a success.
Thank you.

Remarks by the Minister for Foreign Affairs Hon’ble Pradeep Kumar Gyawali at Raisina Dialogue
Posted onJanuary 10, 2019 

Raisina Dialogue 2019, New Delhi
“World Reorder: New Geometries, Fluid Partnerships, Uncertain Outcomes”
Remarks by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Nepal, The Hon’ble Pradeep Kumar Gyawali,
January 10, 2019
——————————————————————————————————————————–
Chair of the Session,
Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen:
Let me start by thanking the Ministry of External Affairs of India and the Observer Research Foundation for giving me this honour. It is a rare privilege to share my humble thoughts before this distinguished audience.
In its fourth year, Raisina Dialogue has become a great platform for churning of innovative ideas.
Generation and dissemination of ideas has been the outstanding tradition of our region. This region was once the wonderful home of the greatest among human civilizations, far advanced in research, innovation, ingenuity and intellectual artifact reflecting the rich tradition of “वादे वादे जायते तत्वबोधः” or “through discourse, essence can be extracted”.
When science and scientific thinking was little known to the world, this region had already produced Vedas and Vedanta; when idea of modern statecraft was still in nascent stage elsewhere, this region had already brought up Arthashastra; when human-centred thoughts were yet to be born, this region already prided itself on Buddhism, the core massage of which is the peace, happiness and welfare of humanity. The uniqueness of ideational pattern of our region is the unwavering conviction on social harmony, discipline, order and larger public good.
Dear Friends,
Much has been said about the changing world order, the shifting paradigm of the world politics, and the rapidly transforming geopolitical milieu around us. Without repeating what scholars and practitioners have already thrashed out so profusely, I wish to make a modest attempt to touch on a couple of questions: what the changing world scenario means for a relatively small country like Nepal, for our neighbourhood and the region; and what kind of global and regional arrangements we would like to see. While doing this, I will also touch upon some aspects of Nepal-India relations today and what these relations would mean for the region and beyond.
Attributes that characterized the world order in the past decades are now covered in the mist of uncertainty. Globalization has been challenged by the very people, who once stood as its determined proponents. Free flow of people, I mean the working people, in fact never happened as restrictions of various nature continued and such restrictions have further been reinforced. What globalization effectively meant was the free flow of goods and services of those who could produce. This pillar of trade globalization seems to be getting shaken today.
Globalization: we may have liked it or not. It has its pros and cons sides. But one thing is true: under globalization, countries were able to uplift unprecedented number of their people out of drudging poverty. Trade exponentially grew; industries expanded; value chains were set up; millions of jobs were created, including in developing countries; and economies were transformed. This was not a small achievement by any means.
There were small players like us who could not reap the full benefits of globalization. We consistently demanded that a level playing field had to be created; an enabling environment had to be there for all to prosper; and the growing economic disparity must be addressed. We continued to voice that no country should be left behind in this historic march towards prosperity. We demanded reform, but we never sought alternative of globalization; never opposed rules-based arrangements of global trade.
Today, the same arrangements face big questions not from us but from the big players, in whose ideas the arrangements were rooted.
Today, technological advancement has brought us closer than ever before and made us more known to each other; but in the mindset, we are getting farther and the border that surrounds us is getting tighter.
Today, the world has become more peaceful than before, but still military expenditure has soared up higher than ever: expenditure that could otherwise have gone for development.
While the world is becoming more interdependent, the challenges ahead require to be addressed with more collective efforts. These include challenges posed by the growing tendencies to weaken multilateralism and collaboration.
While the humankind is making progress to understand and predict the dynamics and adjust with the rule of nature, ironically, we are creating such a situation where unpredictability is prevailing and pre-set rules are being shaken.
What triggered today’s anti-globalization wave? Was it the 2008 financial crisis and its associated impacts on day-to-day life in the developed world? Was it the Brexit referendum? Was it some of the ‘costly wars’? If yes, could these have been avoided? Could the respective leaderships have taken an alternative decision that would yield results otherwise? Does leadership just mean catering to the short-term public sentiments or do leaders have responsibility to sway public opinion for a better result and a more collective welfare? Does the world today seriously lack statecraft required to keep things in better order and organized way? These questions are set to irk us as we embark onto this fluid and uncertain transition.
Uncertain because the existing world order stands challenged and the new order is yet to take shape.
Uncertain because the nature, definition and structure of world power is changing but the new power equation does not seem to be fully acknowledged.
Uncertain because the old alignments are fading and the new ones, at times of hitherto unthought kind, seem to be emerging, which are yet to stand solid and as durable.
Uncertain because there is a growing skepticism about tenacity of what was once deemed as universalism and universal values and the alternative values are yet to take shape.
Uncertain because there are still believers in good number that the current wave against globalization and liberal world order could just be transient and we would all soon return to the same ‘normalcy’.
Anyway, geopolitical contest is today’s reality and economy is at the heart of this contest. Unlike in the past, today it is less of ideological divide, more of who gains from what sort of trade and economic arrangements. And such contest has at times tended towards the zero sum game of harming each other. One good thing about today’s contest is that unlike in the past there is less threat of interstate military warfare. Not so good thing, however, is that the contest has sometimes been pungent.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Small countries do not have resources and capacity to be engaged in such geopolitical contestation.
A country like Nepal has always been a firm advocate of rules-based, predictable international order. We are a believer in multilateralism, where we can get our voices heard; problems and challenges recognized; and support be extended. Small countries may not have adequate strength and competence to engage in bilateral deals with bigger players and this is why they cherish the cushion provided by collective negotiations in multilateral and regional forums. Rules-based order is essential for our survival.
We have always been supporter of multilateral institutions like the United Nations. What we have wanted, though, is its reform to reflect the current realities.
We have always supported rules-based trading arrangements under WTO. What we have wanted is a meaningful preferential treatment to less capable, least developed countries like us so that we can catch up.
We have constructively participated in the existing global economic architecture and have demanded that such architecture should be inclusive, democratic and enabling for the most resource-constrained countries. We have stressed that gaps and deprivation must be addressed.
Nearer in the region, we have always been a campaigner for greater regional integration. We stand for strengthening SAARC and BIMSTEC and the implementation of the agendas of BBIN sub-regional cooperation.
Next door, we have always emphasized on the importance of good and harmonious relations between our two big neighbours. When these two rise together, the rise of Asia becomes unstoppable. We were encouraged, in this context, by the positive vive that last year’s Wuhan summit created. We are of the view that one country’s rise should not be seen as a threat to the other. It could be an opportunity to rise together. The only thing is that right sort of arrangement for rising together has to be there and leaders in the region are capable of getting that ensured.
Having possessed a third of the Earth’s landmass and almost two thirds of the world population, mostly young and energetic, Asia is the fascinating combination of economic strength, demography and unique value system. And with the developed and prosperous Asia, the world will be transformed because this will mean the end of the largest chunk of world poverty.
Cognizant of the fact that we can work together in neighbourhood for our mutual benefit and common prosperity, we have been emphasizing the need of a trilateral partnership between our three countries. Such partnership would entail working together for better physical connectivity, deeper economic linkages and greater people-to-people connections.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Nepal pursues an independent foreign policy. Our conduct of external relations is based on a balanced and independent outlook, which is rooted in the historical fact that we were among the few countries that always remained independent, free from any sort of colonial rule. The 28 million Nepali people harbour today an abounding sense of national pride and patriotism.
Patriotism that does not have ill will against anyone: our people have always demonstrated great degree of resilience in times of difficulties and their confidence was never shaken. Amity with all and enmity with none is our motto in foreign policy. We seek to foster relations with neighbours and all friendly countries around the world based on justice, sovereign equality, trust, mutual respect and benefit.
Nepal is a peace loving country and shuns any kind of military alliance.
Distinguished Audience,
In this august forum where we are talking about world’s transformation, I feel tempted to share with you the transformation of historic proportion that Nepal has been able to achieve in the past few years. Unlike the current global transformation towards fluidity and uncertainty, ours has been transformation towards stability and predictability. With the making of a democratic and inclusive constitution in 2015 and subsequent formation of strong elected governments in the centre, provinces and local levels, Nepal has entered into a new phase, where our main quest is growth, development and prosperity.
Past two decades were challenging time for Nepal. First the country went through a decade long armed conflict and then long transition marked by uncertainty about how we are to seek a constitutional settlement of conflicting political perspectives. Success of peace process depended on our ability to reach this settlement. We finally did it thanks to the prudence of our political leadership, perseverance of our people and support and solidarity from international community. We were mindful of the cost of instability: our development was pushed back; we remained in stagnation while others advanced.
Now under Prime Minister Oli’s leadership, we are committed to work in such speed that would enable us to make up for the two lost decades. We have set a development vision with the slogan of ‘Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepalis’. We have the potential and what we need is resources and technology.
We are known for richness in water resource, which we are yet to convert into hydropower; we are known for natural beauty and cultural diversity, due to which our tourism industry is growing.
We are aware that single-handedly we cannot reach the destination of prosperity. We must seek support from our development partners from around the world, including our rising neighbours.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
India is our close neighbour, with whom Nepal’s relations have been comprehensive and multifaceted. Our economic partnership is robust and has a long history. India is our biggest trading partner, source of FDI and a main transit country. We are connected by geography as well as history, by our religions as well as culture.
Apart from taking effective measures for the implementation of all the agreements and understandings reached in the past, we have common understanding on the need for reinvigorating the existing bilateral mechanisms to promote cooperative agenda across diverse spheres.
Our enhanced engagements at different levels, in particular in recent times, have contributed to taking the bilateral relations to newer heights.
We cherish India’s progress and prosperity. Its accomplishments in many spheres are notable. The wonderful journey of India as a major economic powerhouse is an inspiration for many people around the world and more so in our neighbourhood.
To increase the flow of goods and augment trade between our two countries, we are focused on investing in infrastructures and streamline procedures. We are aware that cross-border connectivity is very important to unleash development potentials and to spur growth.
The importance of connectivity cannot be overemphasized for a landlocked country like ours. With India, we are advancing connectivity by railway and waterways. When I talk about connectivity I recall what Prime Minister Modiji eloquently highlighted, during one of his visits to Nepal, as the HIT formula (highways, information ways and transmission ways). We appreciate in this context a recent positive step taken by India towards making cross border trade of electricity possible. Given Nepal’s hydropower potential and investors’ interest in it, it has long been our demand that cross border trade of electricity be opened up just like other tradable commodities.
Dear Friends,
Back to the world geopolitics again, there is no denial that we all have our respective fundamental national interests that we cannot compromise on. At the end of the day in electoral democracy, we must answer to our people, serve them best and make them happy. It is equally true, however, that there are issues beyond our respective border that we cannot tackle in isolation: issues which our domestic audience is not necessarily aware of and for this reason require correct guidance from leadership. Past experience tells us that global challenges require global solution. At a time when the number and intensity of such challenges have grown manifold, thinking of the world as one is all the more required.
Climate change is one such colossal problem of our time that is staring at us and challenging us if we have the strength, conviction and collective will to find a solution. Reports after reports have forewarned of impending disaster and called for immediate actions. It is disheartening, therefore, particularly for small, vulnerable, resource constrained and least prepared countries like us, to see that the fate of Paris Agreement looms in uncertainty.
Our report card of the Millennium Development Goals was a sort of mixed. We did well with some of the goals while progress in other areas remained illusive. Without collective actions, SDGs will not fare better. Partnership for development is a critical aspect of realization of these internationally determined goals. We are, therefore, concerned about the shrinking development assistance.
As I already said, advancement in information and communication technology has tremendously benefitted us in many ways. This has made us more connected and made us more informed. This advancement has not come without challenge. How are we prepared to address today’s cyber anxiety? Cyber or satellite collapse? As a byproduct of ICT appears the challenge of fake news and propaganda. Information empowers people; misinformation betrays. How are we going to enable our people to rightly filter between information and misinformation?
Likewise, how we are going to tackle the challenges associated with the most contemporary scientific advancements? Robots have started to perform many of the jobs humans did in the past. How are we going to create alternative jobs for our people? Are we all prepared for half men, half robot kind of working environment? How shall we address the chasm that will possibly be created among us by Artificial Intelligence? How are we going to manage the possible unmanned military capability?
New forces of division in the form of sectarian violence, religious extremism and terrorism are gaining ground posing huge threat to individual liberty, democratic institutions and rule of law. Are we able to overcome these without collective efforts?
Growing volume of world trade is taking place over the water. How we are going to make the oceans safer? How are we going to prevent maritime conflict? How are we going to ensure that landlocked countries get better access to sea for trade and transit?
Distinguished Audience,
Challenges the world faces today are too big and too many to be overcome by our lone efforts. History is our witness. There has always been a positive correlation between our collective efforts and world’s peace and prosperity. Such efforts are more required today.
Let us, therefore, be prepared to correct our obsession with short-term gains and think in a larger perspective of long-term collective welfare.
Let us contribute to build bridges rather than barriers.
Let us act in synergy rather than in isolation.
Let us embrace fraternity rather than narrow communalism.
Let us aspire for a better world where we collectively work for common prosperity; a world which future generation can proudly inherit.
I thank you for your kind attention.

Statement by the President of Nepal Rt. Hon. Mrs. Bidya Devi Bhandari
at the 24th Conference of Parties to 
The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)
Katowice, Poland, 3 December 2018
Mr. Chairperson,
 Nepal is a least developed country, comprised of the Himalayas, mountains and the plains known as the Terai. 
We have been bearing the brunt of disproportionate impacts of climate change despite being a low carbon-emitting country. 
Himalayan glaciers are melting; snow-capped mountains are becoming dark and dull; the possibility of glacial lake outbursts is high; and the river- basin system is adversely affected. 
Avalanches, floods and landslides, and droughts have become more erratic than ever before. 
The rural drinking-water system has been disturbed because of the undesirable impacts on natural resources. 
We are compelled to spend significant amount of our national income in addressing disasters-induced problems.
Main productive land of Terai, ‘the granary’ of Nepal, is frequently affected by floods and inundation. Even more severe is the impact on agriculture sector.
Such disasters and incidences have more direct bearing on women and indigent people. We know the hardship of rural women, who are compelled to spend hours to fetch water for household consumption.
We feel as if we have been penalized for the mistakes we never made. 
I would like to reiterate that it is incumbent upon the international community to ensure that justice is done.
We believe that the commitment to maintain the threshold of 1.5 degree Celsius as outlined in the recent IPCC Special Report will further encourage the world community to traverse resolutely in the path of low carbon emission.
We are a country that has been immensely contributing to controlling global warming. 
Himalayan Ranges and high mountains including the Mt. Everest contribute to keeping air and water cool, refreshing and pure. 
In fact, mountains and oceans form organic linkages to influence climate and weather patterns. 
These mountains melt slowly yet continuously to recharge and humidify the land. 
This water recharging system has a prime importance in controlling the temperature of the earth. 
Value of such natural phenomenon should be realized by the high carbon emitting countries as well as the developed ones and ensure that the environment of mountainous countries is not exacerbated. 
We are effortful in minimizing the vulnerability of climate change through the design and implementation of model projects as well as through measures such as National and Local Adaptation and Mitigation Plans of Action. 
With a view to effectively implement the Paris Agreement, we are planning to review the Policy and update Nationally Determined Contributions to make them more relevant in the present context. A long-term strategy is being formulated for their implementation.
We have already started the use of electric vehicles at the President’s Office and we have a policy to extend this to other areas as well.
The Government of Nepal has initiated the President Chure Conservation Program with a view to implementing, in an integrated way, the environment conservation and livelihood programs in the Chure area, popularly known as Shiwalik in Nepal. We believe that this project will contribute to the protection and conservation of the environment of not only the Chure area but also the neighboring countries. 
We are confident that the support and cooperation of the international community will be there in mobilizing knowledge, skills, technology and climate finance in our efforts to promoting study of Himalayan hydrological sciences, supporting sustainable mountain economy, pursuing economic and social development for shifting into renewable energy, employment generation, and ensure access of all Nepal is to clean energy. 
We also believe that climate finance is critical also for developing e-mobility, reducing vulnerability of women and the poor, improving public health, and promotion of forests and natural system in the form of carbon sink.
Nepal remains committed to make the project implementation climate friendly and development efforts compatible with the Sustainable Development Goals. 
It is our collective responsibility to protect our own and that of the future generations’ right to live in clean and safe natural environment. 
Nepal is confident that CoP 24 will find pathways for the effective and faithful implementation of the Paris Accord.
Finally, I hope that this Conference will be able to make significant contributions to the global campaign of environment protection and conservation. I would like to extend my best wishes for the success of this Conference.
I thank you all.

Asia-Pacific Summit, 1 December 2018
“Nepal’s Peace Process: The Dawn of a New Era”
Excellencies,
Distinguished Participants,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Namaste and good afternoon!
It is a distinct honor and privilege for me to extend our warmest welcome to all distinguished guests who have joined us for the Asia-Pacific Summit. 
Our deliberations on this occasion will focus on issues pertaining to the pursuit of peace, prosperity and stability in the world. I do hope that the variety of perspectives and diversity of experience that such discussions bring will be helpful in addressing the many challenges that we face in ensuring a peaceful, secure and stable world. 
It is with this objective in mind that I wish to share with you the unique experience of Nepal’s own home-grown, nationally-initiated and –led peace process that successfully put an end to a decade-long armed struggle, and brought together forces from across the political spectrum to begin a new chapter in Nepal’s long and glorious history. 
Distinguished Guests,
In the past seven and a half decades, Nepal witnessed several episodes of struggles for political freedom, economic development and social progress, the aspirations, which were repeatedly thwarted by the unchecked ambitions of an absolute monarchy. In 1961, for example, Nepal’s nascent democracy suffered a severe blow in the form of a royal ‘coup’ which pushed the country into another three decades of autocratic party-less Panchayat system. 
The incessant and resolute struggles of the Nepali people for democracy and modernization finally culminated into the People’s Movement of 1990, which led to the restoration of multi-party democracy. Unfortunately, our naïve initiative to confine monarchy within the constitutional set up failed again, since the monarchy couldn’t give up its longing for power. In addition, the deep-rooted structures of exclusion and exploitation perpetrated by a centuries-old feudal system continued unabated. Against this backdrop, the conflict in the form of an armed struggle began. A peaceful and peace-loving nation had to admit a dark blot in its history. Though it played an important role in fermenting political transformation, regrettably, the ultimate cost of the armed conflict fell upon the people of Nepal. During the decade-long struggle, several thousand lives were lost; many families were torn apart and vital infrastructure suffered irreparable damages. 
While the world entered the new millennium, the King harbored the ambition of reviving absolute monarchy, pushing the nation into the labyrinth of dictatorship. 
It was at this critical stage that the mainstream political parties and the Maoist rebels realized the need to overthrow absolute monarchy and resolve the decade-long conflict in a peaceful manner. To attain these twin objectives, twelve-point understanding was signed between seven political parties and the rebels, which would be the founding stone of Nepal’s peace process. A compromise was reached this way: the mainstream parties agreed to pursue the constituent assembly election and the republican setup and the Maoists became ready to give up the arms and join the mainstream democratic course. The agreement reflected a prudent and far-sighted – albeit rather late – realization on the part of Nepal’s political parties to honor the popular will of the Nepali people for peace,, democracy and modernization. 
Immediately after, there was a rapid build-up of momentum in the democratic struggle. A peaceful popular uprising, also known as the Second People’s Movement or April Uprising, succeeded in forcing the King to yield sovereign power to its legitimate owner –the Nepali people. The dissolved Parliament was reinstated – and expanded later – as an interim legislature-parliament for broader representation. 
The comprehensive Peace Accord signed in November 2006 between the Government and the Maoists formally ended the armed conflict. The other agreement signed was on the management of arms and armies. These accords were indeed the milestones in Nepal’s homegrown, nationally owned and -led peace process. An interim government was formed with the participation of former rebels to carry out the onerous tasks that lay ahead.
The management of arms and combatants was handled through in-depth and extensive consultations among stakeholders to pave the way for a smooth political process. Some combatants were absorbed into the national army; most of them were reintegrated in society. In tandem, several initiatives were taken for further reform the Nepali Army to make it even more professional and politically neutral while ensuring civilian oversight. 
To build confidence among the parties of the conflict in implementing the peace agreement, Nepal invited a UN Mission, with small size and limited mandate, – mandate to monitor arms management. By and large, its presence in the early days of the peace process was helpful in supporting confidence-building measures among the parties of the conflict. Later we realized that Nepal’s political parties had full trust and confidence in each other’s capability, competence and motivations to carry forward, thence forward the peace process on our own. 
Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen:
As part of the peace process, and to realize the long-held aspirations of the Nepali people, the Constituent Assembly election was held in 2008. The Nepali people voted for an inclusive and representative Constituent Assembly, which declared Nepal a federal democratic republic, abolishing the 240-year old monarchical system. However, the first assembly could not agree on the draft constitution owing to the inconclusive debates on several vital issues such as the structures of governance, mode of representation and the basis of federalization. Another election became necessary for seeking a fresh mandate. 
The second Constituent Assembly continued the democratic process and ultimately adopted a new constitution in September 2015 with the support of over four-fifth majority. The constitution institutionalized federal democratic republic polity in Nepal. 
The overwhelming consensus on the new constitution marked a uniquely successful conclusion of the nationally owned peace process in Nepal. The new Constitution has received wide support and acceptance of the Nepali people, because the Constitution guarantees equality, safeguards fundamental rights and ensures opportunity for all by putting an end to all forms of discrimination. This is no small feat, reflecting the extensive consultations and constructive discussions during the lead-up to its promulgation. 
Last year, the constitutionally mandated elections at all the three tiers of the government – federal, provincial and local, were concluded with a record turnout. The left alliance, which included the formal rebels, won the overwhelming support of the people. Also resonant in the people’s mandate was the strong call for unification of the two largest left parties of Nepal. 
Now the Nepal Communist Party leads the government with over three-fourth support of the parliament. With this historic mandate, Nepal has achieved much needed political stability, and is marching on the way toward a new era of socio- economic transformation. Just a few days ago, for example, the Government started the implementation of an elaborate social safety net for the people.
Our peace process had three major dimensions. On political front, we have accomplished the historical mission by formulating a democratic, just and progressive constitution and introducing a federal and inclusive state structure, which mirrors the multilingual, multicultural and multiethnic society of Nepal. On military or security side, we have settled the combatant issue thru mainstreaming them and making the National Army more representative, inclusive and professional. Now we are finalizing the transitional justice where we have to heal the wounds of conflict, to ensure the new life to thousand of victims and have to end the impunity and prevent reoccurrence of conflict. We are clear- there will be no any blanket amnesty for gross human rights violations, though our major focus will be on the reconciliation. 
Despite insuperable challenges and difficulties, we have successfully navigated through the difficult waters of conflict resolution. Ours has been an exemplary model of peace process and democratic transition. People from a diverse spectrum of political ideologies and backgrounds and from the heterogeneous mosaic of linguistic groups, ethnicities and regions have come together in the political process for a political settlement that caters to their dreams and aspirations for a brighter future. Never before in Nepal’s history were its people consulted at such length, and with such intense sense of purpose and goal-orientation.
Nepal’s experience with peace making and peace-building has been eminently indigenous, with many salient features that are unique to our special circumstances. To quote Prime Minister Rt. Hon. KP Sharma Oli, “Nepal’s case is a unique example of peaceful and democratic transformation. It is a telling testimony that dialogue triumphs the differences; and ballot triumphs the bullets.” (UNGA statement 2018)
Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen:
Let me now share my thoughts with you about the lessons that we have learned from our peace process. 
The important lesson from our experience is that we should not lose sight of the long-term prospects for peace, and that the parties in the conflict should keep on engaging with each other and seek the common grounds despite their differences in perceptions and positions. The spirit of accommodation, consensus and confidence building is a sine qua non for the successful resolution of conflict. Equally important in any homegrown peace process is strong political will, national leadership and ownership. 
As I mentioned earlier, national ownership and leadership have been key features of Nepal’s unique peace process. There are, however, several other significant features in our peace process that deserve special mention, and among them are shared vision and unity of purpose; agreed process and mechanisms, consultation and debate; change with continuity; initiative and leadership; and, pragmatism and flexibility. 
Vision and Unity of Purpose: By signing the 12-point agreement, all the major political forces in Nepal had agreed to a single vision: the vision of a democratic, peaceful, prosperous and socially advanced society by ending autocratic monarchy. Therefore, whenever there were any disagreements, such as in the wake of the failure of the First Constituent Assembly, we knew where to look for: the initial vision for a peace, democracy and prosperity. Other actions would follow on this major consensus, as they eventually did.
Agreed process and institutions: To bring the conflicting parties closer, and to promote ownership, common process and institutions are extremely important. Peace process is not a unilateral step, where one side decides and the other just abides or follows. We developed such institutions and processes, where both side agreed to sit together and deliberate. The 12-point understandings, Cease fire agreement, Comprehensive Peace Accord, Agreement on the management of arms and ammunitions, Interim constitutions were such frameworks, among others, which guided the peace process. Likewise, Interim parliament, Special committee for combatant management and Constituent Assembly were some important mechanisms, which played the role of common bodies in decision making. 
Consultation and debate: The devil lies in the detail, as they say. Therefore, several precious years were lost in agreeing on the details of a peaceful, democratic and prosperous society we all wanted to build. However, we did not block the full expression of each other’s voices, concerns and fears, because they reflected not discord but debate. 
For a time, it seemed as though the cacophony of disparate voices that had permeated through to the very depths of society would shake our confidence and run over any semblance of order or a pathway of conflict resolution. But then gradually, but surely, a pattern evolved. Extreme forms and expressions of ideas began to falter and then died down with a whimper. 
What followed was a spectacular unanimity and consensus on all major issues that we had been grappling with for so many years. Or if there was no unanimity in the beginning, the process itself gave the answer. For instance, there were some grievances during the constitution drafting, and a small number of assembly members abstained in the process. But when the new election under constitution was declared, all sections of society, with overwhelming turnout, participated. Likewise, we began to realize that identity is important, but then it is neither immutable nor unchangeable; besides, we all have multiple identities, all at the same time. We realized that all sections of society should find fair and equitable representation in all layers of political bodies, but then it would also be a good idea to elect some parliamentarians directly for the purpose of promoting leadership and accountability.
Change with continuity: So, while the country was going through a period of momentous change, there was an underlying system of continuity that ensured that abrupt change would not disrupt social structures by setting undesirable precedents. The House of Representatives, which had been dissolved by the King, was re-instated to function as a legislature-parliament by expanding it with the inducting of members from the CPN (Maoist). It was a classic case of change with continuity. 
Initiative and Leadership: However, none of such historic change would have been possible without powerful initiatives and strong leadership. Leadership, in turn, is a product of the material conditions of a society, and the special conditions of our country during those years mandated special initiatives. Given the prevailing security conditions in the country, only strong leadership with a view of the distant future in the eyes, and of the welfare of the Nepali people in the heart, could have dared to sign the 12-point agreement in the first place. I again want to emphasize how much important the role of national leadership is, because for some elements, whether they are insiders or outsiders, both conflict and peace is equally beneficial like trade. Sometimes they invest in conflict and sometimes in peace. If the national actors cannot take the lead, there is always a risk of vicious cycle of never ending conflict. 
Pragmatism and flexibility: Finally, I would like to emphasize the crucial role of pragmatism and flexibility for mutual accommodation, compromise and give-and-take. The history of Nepal’s peace process is replete with numerous instances of pragmatism and flexibility exercised by all parties in achieving their common goals. Three instances of them come instantly to my mind: successful integration of the former Maoist combatants, where the national army and the former rebels agreed to bury their hatchets and made significant compromises early on; when the mainstream parties and CPN (Maoist) quickly realized it was time to move on by agreeing to jointly proceed with the peace process without help from outside the country; and when it was necessary to hold elections for the Second Constituent Assembly, all major political parties were able to agree on the modality of conducting those elections without much delay. 
These are all important lessons, and we need to discuss them honestly, and also credit them duly, lest we forget the how in the past twelve years we have traveled through a most tortuous road fraught with too many roadblocks and far more numerous danger zones to land where we are today. 
Today, the peace process has culminated not only in the management of armed conflict but also to the political transformation of enormous proportions. This has come at a high price for which the Nepali people have shed enormous amounts of blood, sweat and tears. It is time to move on, and to make good on those promises, which were made to our martyrs who willingly sacrificed their lives for the sake of liberty and national rejuvenation. 
Since the political issues have now been settled after a series of protracted struggles, we have a great responsibility for nation building ahead of us. We are well aware of the fact that political transformation can hardly be sustained without social progress, economic transformation and modernization. It is in this sense that the challenge of consolidating and strengthening the edifice of durable peace in Nepal warrants equally far-sighted vision and mutually reinforcing efforts such as those which were required for initiating and completing the peace process. 
The sustainability of peace hinges on the happiness of the people and the prosperity of the nation. Cognizant of this, the Government has set a vision for ‘Prosperous Nepal and Happy Nepali’. Ultimately, the realization of this goal will be the ultimate reward, and the best guarantor, of everlasting peace in Nepal.
With these few observations, I would like to conclude my remarks and thank you all once again for your kind patience.
Thank you.

Speech by Hon. Pradeep Kumar Gyawali, Minister for Foreign Affairs on the theme: “Role of Nepali Diaspora for Development Policies” at Plenary Session 4 of the First NRN Global Knowledge Convention
(October 13, 2018, Time 4:00-6:10 PM)
Chair of the Session Dr. Bhekh Bahadur Thapa
Moderator Mr. Khagendra Dhakal
Distinguished Panelists,
Researchers,
NRN Members,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I am extremely delighted to address this august session on the theme: Role of Nepali Diaspora for Development Policies.
First of all, I thank the organizing committee for giving me the opportunity to share my thoughts.
I touched upon the role of Nepali diaspora to some extent in my remarks at the inaugural session yesterday. I will be brief this time.
With this convention, an important platform for NRN experts and professionals and their counterparts at home has been created to engage in intellectual discussions, debate and knowledge exchange. Cross-fertilization of ideas, views and thoughts is certainly a matter of our mutual interest to deepen quality of knowledge, learning and policymaking.
In this sense, I commend all the panelists for their comprehensive and insightful views focusing on the “Role of Nepali Diaspora for Development Policies”.
NRNs and Nepali Diaspora have been making important contribution to Nepal’s development process for quite some time. There is much larger scope for their engagements in development policies.
As you know, following the promulgation of the new constitution and successful holding of three-tier elections, we have ushered in a new era of peace and stability. It is absolutely necessary for us to make this hard-earned peace sustained for generations to come.
Peace and stability can only be enduring when we achieve and maintain a high, broad-based and inclusive economic growth. The growth that is essential to realize our dream of Prosperous Nepal and Happy Nepali. The present Government has, therefore, accorded top priority to economic transformation to make this dream come true. Our collaboration is necessary for giving support to meet this goal.
In this context, let me underline that maintaining stability, advancing socio-economic transformation, ensuring social justice, good governance and rule of law in the country become all the more critical.
Studies have demonstrated that the rate and quality of development largely depends on evidenced-based policies and sound institutions that implement them in a result-oriented manner. Towards this direction, the Government is making necessary policy and institutional reforms.
However, there are many challenges that lie ahead on our path to fulfill the development dream.
First challenge is to build positive and inclusive institutions;
Second challenge is to enhance quality of factors of production;
Third challenge is to gain efficiency in the economy;
Fourth challenge is to meet double-digit growth rate;
Fifth challenge is to reduce poverty and inequality;
Sixth challenge is to bridge massive infrastructure gaps;
Seventh challenge is to build greater financial resilience;
Eighth challenge is to address risks of climate change vulnerability;
Last challenge is to allocate resources equitably in federal setup.
In overcoming those challenges, an enhanced level of economic partnership with NRNs, Diaspora and private sector is essential.
We have undertaken liberal policy framework in the country, but still it is not sufficient. There is a further need to Government undertake policy reforms. Diaspora can certainly contribute to make more conducive development policies at home as they are well-versed in concepts at work place and context at birth place.
Human capital is a key component in policymaking. Role of knowledge, skill and technology ideas is vital in human capital formation.
Besides investing more in the active factor of production (human capital) within the country, we are eager to make best use of knowledge of those who love Nepal, whose blood is Nepali and whose heart is Nepali. It is undoubtedly the NRNs and Diaspora who are in a unique position in enriching the quality of our human capital. We take every measure necessary for their meaningful engagement.
For a country grappling with brain drain, this event is a stepping stone for reversing it in the form of brain gain. Our ideal goal is to attract best brains into our beloved motherland.
In this context, I congratulate NRNA for their timely initiative to set up Nepal Policy Institute (NPI). The Government of Nepal has also made a similar institute named Policy Research Institute. The collaboration between both the institutes would be relevant and useful for making sound development policies in our country.
No doubt, we need a high economic growth for prosperity. For this, we have a goal of double-digit economic growth. To achieve this goal, physical, social, legal, administrative and economic institutions and infrastructure need be put in place.
Yet again, there is a need to improve good governance, policies, rules and laws and utilize excellent professional capabilities in government, private sectors and diaspora as well.
Once we create positive and inclusive institutions through legal reforms, quality of factors of production such as land, labour and capital will certainly go up.
By using these factors efficiently, we hope to achieve efficiency in our country’s economy.
The gain in efficiency will cause an expansion in the economy which will result in higher economic growth.
It is only through continuous high economic growth and its equitable distribution can prosperity sustain in the country.
In the course of economic development, we require huge resources. Since our domestic saving is not sufficient to meet our resources need, we have to mobilize foreign resources through foreign direct investment.
The Government has been taking various policy, institutional and programmatic initiatives to encourage and facilitate FDI and NRNs’ investment through economic diplomacy.
We are constantly striving to attract investment on export trade and tourism sector. We are also focusing on foreign employment management, technology transfer and climate change financing.
Undoubtedly, knowledge, skills, technology and capital from NRNs and Nepali Diaspora will provide a much-needed impetus for economic development.
Let me give a few account of NRNA and Nepali diaspora’s contributions in the country. NRN Investment and Infrastructure Company that already financed in hydropower sector and a recently initiated investment fund worth of ten billion are an encouraging gesture. Installation of Buddha statue in International Court of Justice; Laprak VDC Post Earthquake Model Residence Project (573 Houses Construction); Local Community Support Programs in Various Districts and many more can be added up in the list. Your promising efforts in making investment in the motherland are really appreciative.
Allow me to spell out me of our priority areas where you can make a visible difference.
• Technologies and techniques for high-yielding agro-varieties that are exemplary in Israel and Australia;
• Agro-mechanization as can be found in Japan or USA;commercial, educational and governance digitalization as practiced in Korea;
• Education and human resource development strategies as those of Singapore and Australia;
• Infrastructures like that of China, development of alternative energies alongside hydropower, science and technology as well as best practices in environmental protection.
As I spearhead the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and being the focal Ministry for NRNs, we expect insightful well-researched policy inputs and recommendations from the Convention.
The Foreign Ministry is always supportive of NRNs right from the beginning to create an enabling environment for them and make most of their meaningful engagements in the country. We are planning to conduct a census like NRN survey in order to take stock of NRN expertise and explore a suitable area of their engagements.
I am confident that knowledge sharing between NRNs and the Government of Nepal will pave the way for developing creative and innovative use of tangible and intangible resources that NRNs and Nepali Diaspora have in order to brighten the face of the motherland.
To conclude, Janani Janma Bhumischa Sworgadapi Gariesi (Mother and Motherland are greater than heaven). We will march ahead shoulder to shoulder as one to accomplish our duty to the motherland.
Thank you for your kind attention.

Statement delivered by Hon. Pradeep Kumar Gyawali, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Nepal, at Nelson Mandela Peace Summit
New York, Monday, 02 October 2018
Madam President,
At the outset, I commend you, Madam President, for convening this important Summit to mark the birth centenary of Nelson Mandela.
I feel honoured to offer sincere tributes to a statesman extraordinaire of our time. He is indeed an epitome of struggle, freedom, human dignity and democracy.
The strength of unity; power of discipline; influence of humility; and result of diligence are the lessons we learn from his life. He taught the importance of reconciliation, forgiveness and compassion, even by forgiving those who had taken his everything away.
Truth eventually emerges triumphant, no matter how strong the adversaries are. The sense of fortitude and sacrifice defeat even the most invincible. His career spanning anti-apartheid activist to visionary President is a living testimony. His ideals will continue to inspire humanity. Nepal proudly recalls its service as a member of the UN Special Committee against apartheid since its inception and as a vice chair for 25 years.
Madam President,
Nepal, the birthplace of the apostle of peace, Buddha, has unwavering faith in peace. Our long contribution to the UN peace operations testifies it.
Nepal shares the vicissitudes of Africa’s revolutionary past. Our history is illustrated by long struggles against aggression of imperialists; authoritarian regimes; socio-economic and political oppression; and the most recent peace process.
Nepali people have demonstrated exemplary resilience in pursuit of peace. Political forces exhibited wisdom and chose path of peaceful resolution of conflict through dialogues and accommodation, the ideals embraced by the late Nelson Mandela.
The home-grown, nationally owned and led peace process successfully transitioned the country to a state of stability and peace after the peaceful democratic elections were held under the Constitution adopted by people’s representatives.
Each conflict situation is unique and demands context-specific solution. As there is no universal model for conflict resolution, there is no single model for addressing the issues of peace and justice. The main thrust of our peace process has been to achieve reconciliation by healing the wounds of the conflict. We believe that as long as the parties to the conflict choose to address accountability issues through a functioning national justice system and seek accommodation through reconciliation, it would be unnecessary to suggest for a recourse to international justice system. This is our understanding about the Para 19 of the political declaration. Nepal has allowed independent transitional justice process take its course as per the laws. We are now well on the path of reconciliation by ensuring social justice, nurturing inclusive society, and delivering good governance.
Nepal reaffirms its faith in the values of world peace. We stand ready to share experiences of our successful peace process.
While I share this success story, conflicts around the world continue unabated. Aspiration of millions for equality, justice, peace and development continue to elude us even after seven decades of the establishment of the United Nations.
Our commitment to forgiveness, reconciliation, humanity and peace – not just in words but in actions – would be true tributes to Madiba.
I thank you

Statement by Right Honourable Mr. K.P. Sharma Oli, Prime Minister of Nepal at UN University for Peace, San Jose, Costa Rica
01 October 2018
Dr. Francisco Rojas Aravena, Rector of the University
Distinguished Professors
Members of the Faculty
Dear Students and Scholars
Senior Officials of the Government of Costa Rica 
Excellencies
Members of My Delegation, and
Ladies and Gentlemen 
Let me, at the outset, convey my deep gratitude to His Excellency Mr. Carlos Alvarado Quesada, the President of the Republic of Costa Rica, for the kind invitation extended to me to pay an official visit to this country. I thank the Government of Costa Rica for their warm reception and generous hospitality provided to me, my wife Radhika and my delegation.
It is my distinct pleasure and honour to be here at this University.
I had heard a lot of good things about Costa-Rica. I am pleased to be in this part of the world, and this beautiful land that hosts the prestigious University for Peace, an important institution that is working towards the realization of the UN charter’s vision for peace and security.
I thought that this was an appropriate forum to share my views on peace and democracy following my participation in the UN General Assembly.  Nothing could be a more relevant forum than this University.
I thank the Rector and the whole University family for your kind invitation.  What touches me more is your decision to confer the honorary doctorate degree on me today. I am humbled to accept this great honour with a deep sense of gratitude.
For me, this honour is an acknowledgement of my country’s successful peace process and appreciation of peace-loving Nepali people.
Moreover, with humility, I must submit that this recognition is bestowed on a citizen of the country that gave birth to Buddha –an apostle of peace.
I must commend the University for its immense contribution, as a center of learning and research, to promoting the culture of understanding, tolerance and peace around the world,
Today, it is my great privilege to address the distinguished audience of erudite scholars, professors and students, among others.
I am pleased to share with the distinguished audience that Nepal has become party to the agreement establishing the University. This is a reflection of our deep commitment to universal peace.
 
Ladies and Gentlemen
Last week, I attended and addressed the General Debate of the 73rd Session of the UN General Assembly. The world leaders gathered in the Assembly spoke of a myriad of challenges that we face today.
Backlashes against multilateralism; growing incidences of terrorism and violent extremism; perpetuating poverty and increasing inequality; rising temperature and rising sea levels; continuing civil wars and sectarian strife; persistent food insecurity were among the issues that prominently figured during the Debate.
No matter where the leaders came from; no matter which countries they represented, they were united in their call for a peaceful planet, shared progress and prosperity of humanity.
In the march against many of these woes, the institutions like this University should be in the frontline. For, they have the answer to the many dilemmas we face today.
Education that inculcates tolerance and compassion, respects diversity and accommodates differences while unleashing the infinite potential of human mind is the answer to the problems the humanity faces today.
After all, education is a lifelong process. As a student, one accumulates knowledge and sharpens skills, which later can be used to navigate the world.
Education is also about making oneself updated and relevant, for what we know and what we do not know today may change.
Education that cultivates culture of peace and tolerance while inspiring innovation and invention is the answer to the dilemmas that the world faces today.
Such education is a building block to build the citadel of peace and prosperity.
I, therefore, would like to commend the contributions that this University has made as a hub of knowledge for conflict prevention and peace.
 
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Contemporary world is a confluence of achievements as well as setbacks, of progress as well as perils, of hope as well as despair.
While the world has witnessed impressive economic growth and phenomenal technological progress, the benefit has not accrued to all equitably. Inhumane poverty still persists. Inequality within and among societies and nations is increasing.
Thousands of lives have been lost due to the civil wars and violent conflicts. The menace of terrorism has not abated, and its tentacles threaten the humanity in every part of the world.
Extremism that doesn’t respect diversity and pluralistic nature of human society is showing its ugly head. We must note that diversity is inherent in nature; and no one can go against this.
The ecological balance has been upset. With the temperature rising, glaciers retreating, snow melting and sea level rising, the climate change has accelerated. And, our responses do not match the enormous challenges that are the results of human recklessness.
Unfortunately, it is the countries with negligible emissions that are bearing the heavy price of climate change. This is unfair and thus unacceptable. We together have the responsibility to hand over a habitable planet to our future generations. We must fulfill our accountability towards them.
With the fourth industrial revolution, many groundbreaking achievements have been made. However, the benefit of technological progress has not been judiciously shared among all. The disruptive potential of such change in the world of work is yet to be assessed fully.
With the millions of people on the move, migration today is a mega trend. The response is needed to ensure that people migrate as a choice but not by compulsion. The world needs to come together to ensure the human rights of migrants and to make migration safe, orderly and regular.
Today, the problems are more interconnected than ever. They are not confined to the borders of countries and continents. They are not confined to particular race and nation.
However, the tendencies undermining multilateralism and search for global solutions are gaining ground.
At the time when response should be joint and collective, rhetoric of isolationism is a regressive move.
At the time when international cooperation should be made more robust, protectionism and erosion of trust in the entire edifice of rule-based international order is a discouraging move, which is unfortunate.
I believe that the world needs, more than ever, to reassert its faith in multilateralism and collective solutions.
And, it is equally important to resurrect and reinvent the rule-based international order, which is inclusive and accommodative of the voices of all countries, no matter how small or big, rich or poor, developed or developing.
 
Ladies and Gentlemen,
A deeper reflection reveals that many maladies of modern times are rooted in human minds.
The attitude of violence sown in some human minds begets wars and human tragedy.
The excess of greed breeding, in some, begets conflict and corruption.
The veil of ignorance imbedded, in some, begets culture of intolerance.
For this reason, foundation of peace should be built in the minds of people. This is also the essence of culture of peace.
The potential of human mind is not optimally realized. Human imagination, innovation and invention have brought tremendous break-throughs in the history.
And this potential of human mind is not yet fully realized. There are millions of people living in backwardness, who, if provided with proper education and opportunity, will be instrumental in rowing the raft of progress. We have to identify the willing minds and invest in them for their fuller development.
Not all people are equal in terms of their capacity. Not all share similar interest in the same subject. Therefore, the role of education is to identify and spur the hidden individual potential through appropriate tools including counseling.
Memory power, and creative ingenuity as well as imaginative power are the two aspects that make human minds superior to others.
Prosperity and progress in isolated enclaves cannot sustain forever if a large chunk of humanity is lagging behind without being able to realize its full potential.
Education should enable human beings to harness the nature’s enormous potentials while bridging the gaps between haves and haves-not and ending deprivation and backwardness. Doing so will contribute to defeat the cause of social tension, discord and conflict.
The utility of education lies on its ability to inculcate positive outlook in human beings. It should also foster moral values. This will enable individuals to judge what is right and what is wrong, where to proceed and where to restrain.
Educating the minds of people will make them better individuals and open newer horizons. But more than that, it should also contribute to the development of societies and nations.
Through education, individuals get enriched. Enriched individuals in turn enrich the families. Enriched families help develop society. Enriched societies contribute to enriching the nations. This, in sum, enriches the understanding among nations at the global level in the interest of humanity at large.
 
Ladies and Gentlemen
Peace is not a mere absence of war. Nor should it be understood as suppressed calmness, forced silence, and circumscribed tolerance.
It is a state of mind, way of living and has much broader dimensions –individual, political, economic, social, and cultural- which are interdependent and mutually reinforcing.
At individual level, freedom with responsibility towards greater good of society is the foundation of peace.
At political level, meaningful participation in political process and logical power sharing contributes to sustaining peace. A perfect mix of rights and duties fosters an environment conducive to peace.
Likewise, in economic realm, for ensuring peace, the disparities between haves and haves-not and the condition of extractive economic exploitation should be abolished. Joblessness must end. Physical and biological human needs that are basic and justifiable must be met.
At socio-cultural level, tolerance and compassion in society and interfaith and civilizational harmony and unity in diversity are the catalyst for peace.
This perspective calls for promoting the concept of comprehensive democracy that embraces political, economic, social and cultural aspects to empower individuals.
In SDGs’ underlying philosophy of ‘leaving no one behind’, I see an element of social justice. My vision of a comprehensive democracy is also anchored on social justice. So, there is a perfect match between SDGs’ ultimate vision and the objective of this comprehensive democracy I am talking about.
I think research programmes of this University could address the interrelationship between comprehensive democracy and SDGs for detailed analysis. In this regard, my Government is willing to contribute to research activities of the University by sending some students.
 
Ladies and Gentlemen
The UN Charter captures the aspirations of people for universal peace –‘to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war’. To promote and defend these aspirations, both structures to maintain and culture to sustain peace are needed.
The international institutions, rules, UN peace missions, and mediation are among the important tools as far as the structures are concerned.
Sincere fulfillment of moral and legal obligations by all Member States and upholding the values of peace and harmony by every citizen are essential to maintain and sustain peace.
Here lies the important role of peace education.
In this sense, the United Nations has done justice to the core of its mandate by establishing this University.
 
Ladies and Gentlemen 
For peace to prevail, the first step is to understand and address the root causes of conflict that are of different scope, scale and nature.
Poverty, inequality and backwardness often provide a breeding ground for conflicts. So do intolerance, intimidation and bigotry.
Self-centered parochialism and lack of far-sightedness further aggravate the situation. A myopic and selective approach does more harm than good.
Environmental distress, discrimination, societal discord, deficit of trust and denial of sovereign rights of nations over natural resources also contribute to fueling conflicts.
More study and research of such causes of conflict can help broaden our understanding and anchor the peace universally.
Universities like this have an important role to generate, preserve and transfer knowledge about peace and conflict resolution.
Needless to say, the custodians of peace are the young people. Therefore, their contribution and stake in consolidating peace is paramount,  so is their role in defending democracy and championing the human rights values.
When I say this, I recall my days as a young political activist fighting for democracy. In those days of autocratic rule in my country, arbitrary detention and torture were common. I myself was imprisoned for fourteen long years that also included a period of solitary confinement of four years.
In our pursuit of democracy, we never relented, never bowed to authority and never gave up our conscience. Our perseverance and indomitable courage shaped our struggles for political transformation.
Inspired by the universal acceptance of human values, we had numerous struggles and movements for people’s rights and democracy that culminated in the promulgation of a democratic constitution in 2015.
Gender perspective in peace is equally important. Women have an important role to play as agents of peace and harmony.
 
Ladies and Gentlemen
The primacy of peace is well established in the teachings of Buddha, who is an enlightened son of Nepal. Born in Lumbini of Nepal, Buddha taught the path of peace and non-violence and his teachings are of eternal relevance to the world.
The relevance and utility of certain things get diminished with the passage of time. But, Buddha’s message is of timeless value. It is as pertinent today as it was in the time of its articulation.
The Charter of the United Nations embraces this eternal and universal message of peace of Buddha.
We find in his teachings an illuminating philosophy for peace.
The essence of Asian philosophy is ‘vasudaiva kutumbakam’, which means the world is one family. Likewise, ‘sarve bhawantu sukhina’, which means all human beings should remain happy, is the core of our welfare vision, derived from long philosophical tradition. The relevance and appeal of these maxims are universal. This philosophy doesn’t discriminate humanity on any ground. Our vision for peace is guided by this philosophy.
Unfortunately, as witnessed in other parts of the world in different times and circumstances, Nepal too experienced a period of armed conflict that was the outcome of the prevailing circumstances and had much to do with dissatisfaction of the people fueled by the lack of opportunities for economic and social development.
However, the political parties of Nepal and the armed rebels managed to come together proactively to resolve the conflict through peaceful means and laid grounds for peace. As a result of a homegrown and nationally led and owned process, a peace accord was signed in 2006, formally ending the armed conflict. Management of arms and combatants was successfully handled to pave the way for political process.
In the last decade, Nepal has undergone political transformation of historic proportions. We moved from a unitary monarchial system of governance to a federal democratic republican polity, which has now been institutionalized by the new Constitution.
The constitution promulgated by the Constituent Assembly elected by Nepali people, is a forward-looking, progressive and human-rights based document which ensures inclusive and participatory democracy, decentralized federal structure, socio-economic justice and rule of law.
This has marked the conclusion of the uniquely successful peace process. Our conflict resolution experience and the peace process can provide an important case study for research works including in this University.
Our experience is a testimony of the fact that with requisite political will and sense of accommodation, negotiations and dialogue can resolve conflicts.
We must be aware of the elements that seek to drive a wedge between different groups by taking advantage of their differences and discords to perpetuate conflict to fulfill their vested interests. We must resolutely defeat them.
 
Ladies and Gentlemen
The historic elections, that were held last year at federal, provincial and local levels not only recorded a high number of participation, but also elected people from all sections of society.
More than 41 percent of women have been elected in the representative bodies at all levels.
Our experience is a testimony of the fact that strong political will and constitutional guarantee can be instrumental in empowering women to ensure their legitimate share as well as in making democracy inclusive.
Having settled the political issues, the history has bestowed on us the greater responsibilities to undertake socio-economic transformation to sustain the political gains we have achieved.
With an overwhelming mandate of people, the government that I head is determined to building on this political transformation and accelerate its drive for prosperity and sustainable development.
Our vision is guided by the long-term goal of “Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali”.
To realize this goal, our priority is to ensure decent jobs and gainful employment for our working age population, modernize our agriculture, utilize our energy potential especially in hydropower, and promote development of infrastructure, connectivity, tourism and human resources.
In doing so, we will need investment in multiple sectors. And we have put right policies in place to make foreign investments in Nepal safe and profitable.
Before concluding, I would like to stress the need to promote enhanced collaboration and cooperation between the University for Peace and universities, think tanks and policy institutions of Nepal in advancing the common cause of peace.
When we talk about interrelationship between peace, democracy and development, we must not forget:
– that democracy and development are contingent upon peace.
– that the investment in development will crumble in the absence of peace.
– that aspirations for democracy will evaporate in the absence of peace.
With this note, I would like to thank you, Dr. Francisco Rojas Aravena, Rector, and the entire University fraternity for the Honorary Doctorate as well as this opportunity to share my thoughts.
I wish the University all success in its noble mission.
Thank you.

Posted onSeptember 27, 2018September 27, 2018 

Statement by Hon. Pradeep Kumar Gyawali, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Nepal, at the Annual Ministerial Meeting of LDCs
(New York, 26 or 27 September 2018)
As delivered
Mr. Chairman,
Honorable Ministers,
Under Secretary General and High Representative for LDCs, LLDCs and SIDS,
Distinguished Delegates.
At the outset, I commend Bangladesh for its role as chair of the Group of Least Developed Countries for the last three years, leading the Group so successfully, and welcome Malawi as interim chair of the Group.
I also take this opportunity to appreciate the role played by the UN Secretary-General as well as by the OHRLLS team.
Mr. Chairman,
LDCs are the battleground on which the 2030 Agenda will be won or lost. Stakes are high for us. And the cost of non-achievement is even higher.
In implementing 2030 Agenda, the experience till date shows a mixed progress for LDCs. Nepal is localizing the SDG implementation, remains committed to a balanced and robust economic development with a high growth rate.
Only a handful of LDCs are expected to reach the SDG target of at least 7% GDP growth per annum by 2019.
The increasing trade tensions these days hurt the furthest behind most. More than that, it assaults the very philosophy of a rule-based and fair global trade regime.
The structural constraints of poverty, inequality and unemployment continue to impede the pace of progress in LDCs. Adverse effects of climate change, natural disasters and internal conflicts further compound the challenges. Those LDCs, which are also geographically constrained, such as landlocked and small islands, are more vulnerable to these shocks. They bear higher cost of production, transportation and low comparative advantage of their exports.
International community should come forward to ensure market access, remove tariff and non-tariff barriers, lift quantitative restrictions, and help capacity building and technology transfer. They need financing and investments to conquer poor infrastructures, narrow production and export bases, dismal capital formation, and low factor productivity.
It is high time that all stakeholders, including the international community, deliver on their commitments.
Mr. Chairman,
The priorities of the Istanbul Program of Action (IPOA), re-endorsed by its Mid-Term Review, are critical to the development of LDCs. What we need is a strong synergy between the implementation of IPOA and the 2030 Agenda.
Nepal welcomes the operationalization of Technology Bank for LDCs in Turkey. With this, SDG target 17.8 has been achieved, the first ever target to have been met. The Bank needs to be adequately resourced, so that it can provide much-needed science, technology and innovation support to LDCs.
This year, in its triennial review, the Committee on Development Policy (CDP) has recommended four countries for graduation. It is encouraging that never have so many countries been identified for graduation at a single review.
Still, we fall short to meet IPOA’s aim to enable half of the LDCs to meet the graduation criteria by 2020. A robust response is required to ensure that a greater number of LDCs are prepared for graduation. Most importantly, the graduation must be smooth as well as sustainable.
For many LDCs, the graduation criteria itself fails to capture the reality in its entirety, which deserve a revisit.
Nepal met two out of three criteria for graduation for the second consecutive triennial review this year, but we still have low per capita income. Sustainability of our development progress is a major challenge. As the country is recovering from the disastrous earthquake of 2015 and continues to remain vulnerable to natural disasters, the decision regarding our graduation has been deferred till 2021.
We are now intensifying our development efforts to build ground for sustainable graduation as well as to become a middle-income country by 2030.
Mr. Chairman,
In June this year, the UN Member States adopted a transformative resolution on repositioning of UN Development System. It is our hope that a reinvigorated system works better for LDCs. If the system fails, LDCs would bear the severest of the brunt.
As I conclude, Mr. Chair, I would like to stress that the development path of LDCs should not remain slow, long and vague. The crucial phase of implementing 2030 Agenda as well as IPOA cannot go squandered. The greatest challenge in front of us is resource gap. International support measures should complement our national efforts.
The clock is ticking, and we cannot afford to lose a single opportunity.
I thank you all.

Remarks by Hon. Mr. Pradeep Kumar Gyawali Minister for Foreign Affairs of Nepal at the Ministerial Meeting of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) 
New York, Wednesday 26 September 2018 (9 AM – 1 PM)
As delivered.
[Theme- “Upholding the UN Charter and the Purposes and Principles of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM): Towards a Culture of Peace”]
Mr. Chairman,
I would like to appreciate the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela for the leadership provided to this movement.
I also thank the Coordinating Bureau for selecting a very relevant theme for today’s interaction.
Mr Chairman,
The world today is facing uncertainties. Multilateralism is confronting with cynicism. The idea of a rule-based, just and equitable international order meets with challenges.
In different regions, conflicts remain unabated. The race for armaments and disregard of international law endanger international peace and security. Violence in many parts of the world has brought untold miseries, deaths and agony.
The battle against poverty is still not won. Inequality within the countries as well as between the North and the South is increasing. The forces of globalization have not benefitted all. Tentacles of terrorism have plagued many countries and people.
In these uncertain times, the challenges today are many; and global are their ramifications.
This context calls us to go back to the basics-

to reflect on the solemn pledge that the world made almost 73 years ago through the UN Charter, to save the succeeding generations from the ‘scourge of war’;
to reflect on the fundamental principles of NAM which are time tested and are as relevant as they were at its founding.

These principles are the universal norms for conduct of healthy inter-state relations, and they make guiding ethos of the foreign policy of my country.
As the torch bearer of rule-based, inclusive and multilateral world order, the onus lies on our Movement to uphold the UN Charter as well as the principles of Non-Aligned Movement, both of which are the embodiment of culture of peace.
Mr. Chairman, 
Also going back to another basic, we should not forget that the seed of wars and conflicts is sown by the ‘culture of violence.’
The first line of defence against this should be built in the minds of people –by instilling in them the ‘culture of peace’- the culture which is inclusive and tolerant; the culture of solidarity and social cohesion; and the culture of pluralism and peaceful co-existence. These are the values that the UN Charter and the founding principles of our Movement bind us together.
The citadel of peace cannot stand upright if we fail to anchor it well in the way of our living, thinking, attitude and behaviour.
The culture of peace is also about shared prosperity and full realization of all human rights, including the right to development. It is about full adherence to peaceful means for the settlement of disputes.
Mr. Chairman,
Our Movement – a mosaic of different cultures, faiths, political beliefs and social systems –has been a platform for promoting dialogue among cultures, civilizations and religions.
We cannot remain a bystander when members of our own Movement are engulfed in violence and conflicts. The very principles of the Movement must inspire the Member States towards building a culture of peace. We ought to muster courage to desist from such state of violence, and nurture culture of peace first within ourselves.
As a founding member of the Movement, Nepal upholds its faith in the principles of NAM. We firmly believe in its continued relevance as its principles transcend time.
A country that went through a decade-long conflict and resolved it resolved through a home-grown and uniquely successful peace process, Nepal is strongly convinced that peaceful and inclusive dialogue leads to the lasting peace.
Needless to say, sustaining peace cannot be complete without addressing the root causes of conflicts, delivering development, practicing equality, respecting diversity; and cultivating a sense of ownership among all. In multicultural societies, this is a precursor to peace, stability and harmony.
Nepal believes that the culture of peace is the ultimate signpost to the path of peace, happiness and prosperity for humanity.
In the end, Mr. Chairman, I would like to conclude by encouraging the fellow members to act with solidarity and unite our strengths to contribute to the world peace, while leaving no one behind.
I thank you all for your attention.

Posted onSeptember 27, 2018September 27, 2018 

Remarks by Foreign Secretary, Mr. Shanker Das Bairagi, at the High-Level Plenary Meeting to Commemorate and Promote the International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons[1]
New York, Wednesday 26 September 2018 (9 AM – 1 PM)
As delivered.
Mr./Madam Chair,
It is an honor to join this important meeting to commemorate and promote the International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons.
Nepal welcomes this opportunity to reaffirm our solidarity and support to the efforts for making the world free of nuclear weapons.
I align this statement with the NAM statement.
The catastrophic humanitarian and environmental consequences of the nuclear weapons should not ever be allowed to occur.
Nepal stands for time-bound, general and complete disarmament, and unconditional elimination of all weapons of mass destruction, including the nuclear weapons. We believe that total elimination of the existing nuclear weapons and the assurance that they will never be produced again are the only absolute guarantee against their catastrophic consequences. This can only ensure universal peace and security.
We believe that resources wasted for building and maintaining nuclear arsenal should be diverted to peace and development. Nuclear science and technology should be used only for the peaceful purposes, such as for the advancement of health services, clean water, agriculture, nutrition, food security, climate action and access to energy for all.
Nepal is a State party to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. We are a signatory to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Last year we supported the adoption of the Nuclear Weapons Prohibition Treaty and later we signed it. Ratification of both CTBT and NWPT are being taken up with due priority.  We support UN Security Council resolution 1540 and remain fully committed to its implementation.
It is fitting to highlight the 1996 Advisory Opinion of International Court of Justice (ICJ), which states that the threat or use of nuclear weapons constitutes a crime against humanity and a violation of international law.
Mr. President,
Nepal does not believe that nuclear weapons are useful deterrents. Instead, they are a cause of security dilemma and should not find any place in any national security doctrines.
Modernization of the nuclear arsenals, ongoing research on new nuclear warheads and the development of new delivery vehicles needs to be halted.
Nepal also believes that women, youth, civil society, academia and the private sector have critical roles in raising awareness of the wider population against nuclear weapons.
We also urge for the timely convening of the UN High-level Conference on Nuclear Disarmament as per the General Assembly resolution.
In closing, Mr. President, let me reiterate Nepal’s unwavering commitment to playing its part in supporting efforts for the total elimination of nuclear weapons.
Thank you.
[1] The 26th of September 2018 marks the fifth consecutive year the UN will commemorate the International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons. Established in 2013 through the adoption of UN General Assembly resolution 68/32, the day calls for the world community to reaffirm its commitment to global nuclear disarmament as well as to educate the public about the threat posed to humanity by nuclear weapons and the necessity for their total elimination.

Statement Delivered by Minister for Foreign Affairs at 62nd General Conference of the International Atomic Energy Agency
Posted onSeptember 19, 2018September 20, 2018 

62nd General Conference of the International Atomic Energy Agency Statement Delivered by Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Leader of the Nepali Delegation Honourable Mr. Pradeep Kumar Gyawali
Vienna, 17 September 2018

Madame President
Madame Acting Director General
Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen
 
I begin by congratulating you, Madame President, on your election to the chair of this General Conference. I assure you of my delegation’s full support.
Madame President,
Nepal’s abiding faith in multilateralism emanates from our deep commitment to the principles and purposes of the UN Charter, the values of Panchasheela, and the norms of world peace. We consider that only through dialogues, negotiations and engagements in multilateral setting, the world community can address the global challenges that we in isolation cannot. As the world becomes increasingly complex, the problems we face become equally intractable. This is where the value of multilateralism, collaboration and cooperation among the sovereign States appears critical to build synergy, muster strength and confront the challenges collectively.
Nepal considers that all three pillars of the United Nations- peace and security, human rights and development- should receive equal emphasis. We believe that advancement in science and technology should contribute to the strengthening of the development pillar of the United Nations.
Almost three years have passed since the UN General Assembly adopted the Agenda 2030 for sustainable development with a commitment to leaving no one behind. This is a fitting time that we deliberate in this important forum how the nuclear science and technology can be beneficially utilized for attaining SDGs. I am glad to note that IAEA has calibrated its activities  to facilitate this process and help achieve the goals related to health, clean water, agriculture, nutrition, food security, climate action and access to energy for all. These are critical areas for reducing poverty, sustaining progress and enhancing benefit of technological advancement for humanity. Indeed, with its  fundamental tenet “atom for peace and development” IAEA had always captured the very essence of this idea.
Madame President,
We deeply value our membership and partnership with IAEA. Though use of nuclear science and technology is still very limited in Nepal, our joining as a Member State of IAEA in 2008 has broadened our understanding of application of nuclear technology and its utility for socio-economic development. Important innovations in medicine, energy and other industrial applications have been developed through the use of nuclear technology. Countries like ours need technical support for properly utilizing nuclear science and technology for development, building capacity, complying with the safeguard regime and ensuring safety and security of nuclear and radioactive materials.
Since the signing of RSA[1] Concerning the Provision of Technical Assistance and the Fifth Agreement to Extend the 1987 RCA[2] for Research, Development and Training in 2012, Nepal has become beneficiary of IAEA’s technical cooperation. The area of technical cooperation includes building of national infrastructure for radiation safety, developing radiation health service infrastructure, increasing animal productivity and trans-boundary diseases control, improving crop yield for food security, education in nuclear physics and chemistry, and non-destructive testing among others.
We have seen good results of the projects in the application of nuclear science and technology for peaceful purposes. Nuclear medicine services have been strengthened and expanded in Nepal. Diagnosis and treatment of cancer disease has become more effective and affordable to the needy and poor. The cooperation has helped capacity building of Nepali technical experts as well as institutional capacity building of some academic and scientific institutions. Now we are engaging with IAEA to prioritize national programs and projects with a view to sustain the achievements and help implementing SGDs. Last year we had the pleasure to host the Director General of IAEA Mr. Yukiya Amano on visit to Nepal.
Nuclear science and technology should be used only for the peaceful purposes within recognized safeguard framework of IAEA. To give it an effect, in 1972, we signed the Comprehensive Safeguard Agreement with IAEA. Ever since, we have not only adhered to the Treaty provisions but also stood for stringent safeguards measures and IAEA verifications. Nepal has introduced Nuclear Materials Regulatory Directives and has adopted National Nuclear Policy. We are in the process of enacting separate nuclear law to create a sound regulatory framework within the country. We believe that only a robust regulatory framework at the national levels can ensure better nuclear security and safety at the global level.
Madame President,
Nepal strongly believes that the international community, while complying to such frameworks prescribed for the peaceful uses of nuclear technology, should equally espouse the principles of general and complete disarmament of all weapons of mass destruction particularly the chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear weapons. We believe that resources of armaments should be diverted to peace and development. We consider that sustainable peace can be achieved only through dialogues and collaboration, not through armaments. We believe in utilizing science and technology for creating new and fair development opportunities for all.
To confirm this belief, Nepal was one of the original signatories of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons which we ratified in 1970. We are a signatory to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Last year we supported the adoption of the Nuclear Weapons Prohibition Treaty and later we signed it. Ratification process of both of these treaties is being initiated with due priority.  We are a State party to the Chemical Weapons Convention and Biological Weapons Convention. We strongly support UN Security Council resolution 1540 and remain fully committed to its implementation. These international regimes not only compliment but also support and sustain the momentum towards non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament with NPT as its cornerstone.
Madame President,
Before I conclude, allow me to briefly update about the uniquely successful peace process through which Nepal transitioned to a state of democratic peace and stability.  In the process we concluded a decade long armed conflict peacefully, managed arms and armed combatants and integrated them into the society, restructured the State, empowered women and hitherto marginalized communities, managed diversity and adopted democratic constitution through an inclusive and democratically elected Constituent Assembly and formed stable governments in all three tiers of federal structures through democratic elections. It was a home-grown, nationally led process owned and supported by our people. The peace process has established a culture of dialogue, accommodation, and mutual respect among the stakeholders within the country.
To sustain the political gains and building on the democratic foundation that has been created, we are now focused on attaining economic development with a vision of ‘Prosperous Nepal and Happy Nepali’. This vision is closely aligned with SDGs, and we intend to implement this through promoting investment, propelling economic growth, creating job, maintaining stability, and ensuring social justice, good governance and rule of law.
Excellencies, 
In today’s globalized world, no country can walk alone in the pursuit of development and prosperity. Only through partnership, cooperation and collaboration we can collectively reach to that destination. Nepal is keen to forge that partnership for collective prosperity.
I thank you for your attention.

Valedictory Address by Hon. Mr. Pradeep Kumar Gyawali, Minister for Foreign Affairs, in International Conference on Belt and Road Initiative: Opportunities and Implications for Nepal and the Region
Posted onSeptember 12, 2018September 13, 2018 


Valedictory Address by Hon. Mr. Pradeep Kumar Gyawali, Minister for Foreign Affairs, in International Conference on Belt and Road Initiative: Opportunities and Implications for Nepal and the Region organized by Master’s Program in International Relations and Diplomacy (MIRD), Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu on 12 September 2018.
Vice Chancellor of Tribhuvan University,
Program Coordinator of MIRD
Distinguished Experts from Different Countries
Distinguished Participants
Dear Students
Friends from Media
Ladies and Gentlemen
Let me begin by thanking the Tribhuvan University, Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences for bringing out such a pertinent topic Belt and Road Initiative: Opportunities and Implications for Nepal and the Region for deliberation.
I have immense pleasure to speak a few words as valedictory remarks in this enlightened gathering. As the program has come to an end after extensive deliberations on the topic among the experts from Bangladesh, India, Laos, Nepal, Pakistan, Singapore, Sri Lanka and Thailand, we have already heard thoughtful remarks and summary as well by distinguished experts on country specific perspectives on BRI and its opportunities and implications.
The Rt. Hon. Prime Minister of Nepal K P Sharma Oli has already shed light on the theme of today’s Conference in his inaugural speech this morning. You might have got the opportunity understand Nepal’s perspectives on the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). I would like to put my brief remarks on the same topic. This may sound repetitive.
‘The Trans-Himalayan Silk Road’ and ‘The Tea Horse Trail’ dating back to millennia were ancient routes of great influence. Nepal was a lynchpin in that ancient Silk Road. The trans-Himalayan routes had immense influence on the life of a vast stretch of land extending from present-day western China, Central China to Turkmenistan, Bamiyan (Afghanistan), Mongolia, Nepal, Bangladesh (Chittagong), Sri Lanka, and India (from Kolkata to Kashmir).
The large-scale trade and cultural exchanges between South Western China and South Asia since ancient times contributed not just to cross-border trade and commerce but also to cross-civilizational exchanges and cross-fertilization of ideas across the continents.
In view of these historical facts, we have welcomed the BRI, a landmark initiative taken by the President of the People’s Republic of China, His Excellency Xi Jinping with the aim of ‘building a community of a shared destiny’ and greater cooperation among nations. We visualize great opportunity to work together with China in this broad mission for peace, prosperity and harmony.
Dear friends,
China has made unprecedented strides in socio-economic and technological developments. It has improved significantly the quality of life of its people. Its willingness to share the fruits of development with neighbouring countries for mutual benefits through the BRI is commendable. In view of historical linkages between Nepal and China as well as considering the present day reality between the two countries, Nepal has joined the BRI last year.
As you are aware, after the consolidation of political gains, we, in Nepal, have embarked on the journey of socio-economic transformation. Our vision is guided by the goal of “Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali.”
In order to achieve this overarching goal, we need, among other things, to develop physical infrastructures within the country and enhance cross-border connectivity with both of our neighbours.
Connectivity within the country and across the borders is very important for development. This is also a prerequisite for regional cooperation. As Nepal enjoys excellent bilateral relations with both of our neighbours, India and China, which have emerged as global economic powers, we would like to take advantage from their progress and prosperity.
Our development needs are many but resources at our disposal are limited. We hope that BRI could help meet our financial needs for project development.
Recently, during the visit of the Rt. Hon. Prime Minister of Nepal to China, our two countries agreed to intensify the implementation of bilateral MoU on BRI to enhance connectivity encompassing such vital components as ports, highways, railways, aviation and communication under the overarching framework of trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network.
Under this framework, our two countries have already started cooperation for cross-border railway project. Development of cross-border railways between Nepal and China is a priority for the Government of Nepal along with other connectivity related infrastructure. Whereas cross-border optical fibre link between Nepal and China has already come into operation since early this year.
We have recently finalized the text of Protocol to the Agreement on Transit Transport signed between Nepal and China in 2016. This will enable us to get access to the East Asian sea via Chinese territory. Being an LDC, this is an important aspect of diversifying Nepal’s access to sea for its transit transport. We want to transform our country from a land-locked to a land-linked one.
We have similar cross-border connectivity with India in the forms of highways, railways, info-ways and pipeline. We hope these initiatives would be milestones in linking the South Asia with south western part of China via Nepal in the future.
Thus, connectivity has become one of the important foreign policy priorities of Nepal.
Dear friends,
We think that the projects related to BRI should aim at utilizing the rich resources available along the Himalayan range, and improving the quality of lives of peoples in those areas. The facilities and infrastructures thus created will not only raise the standards of living of the people, but also support the conservation efforts and help for sustainable development of that region.
Most important thing is that, contrary to perceptions in certain quarters, we will be guided by our enlightened national interest to select and implement the project.
We also believe that the concept of trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network comprising the components of railways, highways, ports, aviation and communication linkages across the Himalayas would be significant for opening up new vistas of economic engagements in multiple areas and supporting for the livelihood of peoples in the region. For advancing cooperation under the trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network, we need more understanding, collaboration and partnership.
Nepal has abundant natural resource endowments, whereas Chinese enterprises have technological and financial resources for investment. We need to work assiduously to synergize from these vast potentials for development projects in the coming days.
BRI is not just about physical connectivity. People to people exchange is also a vital component of BRI. Tourism is an area where China and Nepal both can benefit through greater cooperation. Developing tourism services would be a promising area to forge bilateral collaboration for win-win cooperation since Nepal is endowed with natural beauty, cultural diversity and unique adventure sites.
Co-operation and exchanges among academic institutions, think tank, research institutes and intellectuals between Nepal and China are equally important in order to sharing experiences and harmonizing the learning process between the two countries. It is a matter of satisfaction that regular exchange of visits and interactions are taking place between the universities and think tanks of Nepal and China.
Dear friends,
Nepal and China have been enjoying excellent bilateral relations for over a period of six decades. In fact, our contacts are quite old dating back to millennia. Our enhanced partnership in economic field will match the trust and understanding we enjoy in our political relationship. The BRI offers such a unique opportunity for us to cooperate and collaborate for common benefit.
I believe the conference has been able to achieve the outcomes as anticipated. I also believe that the compilation of views shared by experts will be useful for all of us.
Once again, I appreciate and thank the coordinator and team of the Master’s Programme in International Relations and Diplomacy, Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences for arranging such a wonderful program on contemporary issue and for inviting us.
Thank you for your kind attention!

Experts from Different Countries,
Friends from Media,
Ladies and Gentlemen:
It gives me immense pleasure to be amidst with you this morning in the inaugural session of the International Conference on Belt and Road Initiative: Opportunities and Implications for Nepal and the Region.
I would like to thank the organizers for creating a platform for timely deliberation among the scholars, experts, diplomats, students and interested people of this region.
I extend a warm welcome to participants from overseas and wish them a pleasant and comfortable stay in Nepal.
I believe that the discourse on this pertinent theme will contribute to further crystalize our understanding and yield pragmatic suggestions. Moreover, I hope that this programme will facilitate the sharing of experiences among the participants.
 
Ladies and Gentlemen
After the consolidation of political transformation of historic proportions, Nepal is now at an important juncture of undertaking socio-economic transformation. Our key agenda are good governance and socio-economic development.
The vision of the government is guided by the long-term goal of “Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali”. To achieve this goal, we will have to ensure decent jobs and gainful employment for our working-age population, and modernize our agriculture. Similarly, we will have to utilize our energy potentials especially in hydropower, and promote development of infrastructure, tourism and human resources.
In a nutshell, Nepal’s development needs are manifold while the resources remain untapped and underutilized. The financing gap is conspicuous.
We believe that unprecedented economic transformation that is taking place in China and India offers huge opportunities for Nepal. As a country situated between the two economic powers, Nepal cannot remain forever in the lower rung of the development ladder. We must climb the ladder, and climb at a faster pace.
Onus lies on us, to complement our national efforts by ensuring mutually beneficial cooperation with our neighbours.
 
Ladies and Gentlemen,
The Belt and Road, a visionary initiative launched in 2013 by Chinese President Xi Jinping, is an important step that aims at promoting connectivity and cooperation among the countries in the region and beyond.
BRI connects nearly two-thirds of world population which account for one-third of global GDP and trade. The transformative scale and scope of this initiative has opened up plethora of opportunities to integrate the economies, to connect the markets, and to invest in infrastructures.
As President Xi has outlined, BRI lays out a mutually beneficial framework to build the ‘community of common interest’ and ‘community of common destiny’.
To realize Nepal’s development agenda and prosperity goal, it can serve as an important catalyst. We believe that BRI can support countries like Nepal to grow and prosper at a greater speed by ensuring equitable benefits to us.
As a framework to spur investment and enhance connectivity, BRI can be instrumental in addressing our development bottlenecks; in mobilizing finance our development needs; and in ensuring win-win cooperation.
While the resource gap looms large at global level, BRI can also be instrumental in implementing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This way, it will serve the global goods in the interest of humanity.
While the increasing protectionist tendencies are eroding the rule-based multilateral trading system, BRI can be an option for openness and shared benefits.
While the locus of economic development shifts to Asia, BRI can be an engine for a new wave of globalization. Globalization which is inclusive; globalization which is just; and globalization which is humane.
 
Dear Friends
The economic growth and development of China is one of the inspiring success stories of our time. In the four decades of reforms and opening, China has maintained an annual average economic growth rate of 9 %. During this period, China’s share in the world economy increased from 2.7 % to 16 %; its GDP per capita shot from $ 1000 to $ 8000.
China has uplifted 800 million people out of poverty and the country has emerged as the second largest economy in the world.
These impressive figures have astonished the world.
Moreover, it has also been an important player in innovation and technological revolution.
This year marked the 40th anniversary of the reform and opening up of China.
The tremendous progress made by China in the forty years of reform and opening-up stood testimony to the wisdom of its great leader Deng Xiaoping, who said, “Development is the absolute principle.”
The drive of opening up and reform was indeed a milestone. In a sense, the process of reform and opening up has been complemented by BRI at regional and global level.
When fully implemented, the BRI as well has the potential to become a similar milestone –a force of development and a source of innovation.
 
Dear Friends
Connectivity remains at the core of prosperity. The connectivity of infrastructures can unleash multiplier effects in economy.
With enhanced connectivity, vast opportunities for trade, investment, tourism and people-to-people relations will open up. Cooperation in these sectors will create jobs for the people, multiply economic opportunities and enhance the productivity of the entire economy.
Cognizant of this, Nepal and China have committed to enhance connectivity encompassing vital components including ports, roads, railways, aviation and communications within the overarching framework of trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network.
We believe that these are vital components for sustainable regional cooperation as well.
 
Ladies and Gentlemen
Nepal used to be an important thoroughfare in the historic Silk Route. It was a vibrant trade entrepot that connected China with the region of South Asia.
Given its location and amicable relationship with its neighbours, Nepal can contribute as a connecting hub in the region.
Nepal will have much to offer as a vibrant bridge.
A bridge which is not only physical or geographical; but also, cultural and civilizational.
A bridge that connects not only markets and economies; but also, people and minds.
For a landlocked country like Nepal, the importance of connectivity is paramount for ensuring access to the global value chains.
Few days ago, Nepal and China finalized the text of Protocol to Agreement on Transit Transport. This Agreement provides Nepal access to all the Chinese sea ports.
This is an important milestone towards Nepal’s transformation from a landlocked to a land-linked country.
Also, we concluded another MoU for building cross-border transmission line with China this year. Trans-Himalayan railway will be a game changer in our development journey. Our two countries have already signed an MoU on Cooperation in the Railway Project. Pre-feasibility study has already been completed.
Our two countries have started discussions on various BRI related projects.
Connectivity remained the core area of my discussions with President Xi and other State Leaders in China on my both visits.
Similarly, Nepal and India are committed to further intensify cross-border connectivity –connectivity of railways, highways, transmission line and gas pipeline. Likewise, Nepal has signed a power trading agreement with Bangladesh as well.
The regional organisations such as SAARC and BIMSTEC are also important platform for multidimensional regional connectivity. We must make these regional organizations fully functional and result oriented. Connectivity was the most important topic of our deliberations during the 4th BIMSTEC Summit. We have signed an MoU on Energy Grid Interconnection, demonstrating our keen desire to promote cooperation in the vital sector of power.
Once we develop adequate connectivity, the land-linked Nepal can also be ‘the land that links’.
 
Ladies and Gentlemen
Each country has its unique realities and requirements. “One-size-fits-all” approach cannot cater to diverse development needs of different countries and regions.
The development path of any country is dictated by the ground realities and socio-economic context.
I would like to dispel apprehensions, if any, by stating that the Government will be solely guided by the national interest in selecting or accepting projects and programmes under any bilateral, regional or multilateral mechanisms. We will not be swayed away by any opinion or views that are not objective and grounded on realities.
Nepal’s priority is to liberate the people from the inhumane trap of underdevelopment and to break the vicious cycle of poverty.
Unhealthy mix of inertia and cynicism, unfortunately, will only perpetuate such trap.
And if we fail to take the call of the time, then it will be the biggest crime against the generations to come.
To realize the agenda of prosperity, we will pursue the avenues of cooperation with our neighbours in conformity with our national interest and priorities.
Nepal and China are close friends and good neighbours, sharing a historical friendship which has always remained cordial and trouble-free. Guided by the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence, our two countries are determined to take our relationship to newer heights for our mutual satisfaction. BRI offers a unique opportunity for both of our countries to explore and exploit vast potentials for development for shared prosperity.
As I conclude, I wish the conference all success and wish for your productive deliberations.
Thank you all for attention!

Opening statement of Minister for Foreign Affairs, Hon. Pradeep Kumar Gyawali
Posted onAugust 29, 2018 

Excellencies,
Distinguished Delegates,
Namaste and good morning!
I am pleased to welcome all of you to this Ministerial Meeting.
I would like to express my deep appreciation to Your Excellencies, the Honorable Foreign/External Affairs Ministers of the BIMSTEC Member States, for accepting our invitation to attend this Meeting.
I wish you all a very pleasant stay in Kathmandu.
This meeting precedes the Fourth BIMSTEC Summit which will commence tomorrow. Therefore, today’s deliberations and decisions will be of vital importance for the success of the Fourth Summit and also for further strengthening of cooperation under the BIMSTEC process. 
Excellencies and Distinguished Delegates, 
BIMSTEC that connects South Asia with SouthEast Asia-two vibrant growth poles- is a unique regional platform. Our region shares history, geographical contiguity, great civilizations and has huge potentials. Bestowed with natural and human resources, we can collectively contribute to realizing a peaceful, prosperous and sustainable Bay of Bengal region.
Moreover, the recent global economic outlook points to a bright sky with emerging Asia having strong growth prospect. BIMSTEC countries individually remain at the forefront of the economic dynamism. Collective regional economic framework certainly enables BIMSTEC to perform better on economic front. 
However, we are still grappling with numerous economic, social and environmental problems. The challenges of poverty, hunger, backwardness, inequality, natural disasters, environmental degradation, terrorism, organized crimes, illicit drugs and human trafficking; to name a few are daunting. This is a sad predicament and ignominy for us. 
BIMSTEC has completed two decades of journey. Though we have made some progress, it has not matched the potentials. So, it is a time for retrospection and serious analysis. 
This is the time to address this precarious situation in a determined manner. This is the time to do away with business-as-usual approach. We must pursue our goals with renewed vigor in a focused and time-bound manner. We must display our quick, collective and firm response to our collective problems. What is required is sincere pursuit of concerted efforts with the common understanding that deeper integration results in a win-win outcome for all of us. 
If we are to achieve regional growth and prosperity, there is a need to deepen rather than broaden and proliferate areas of cooperation under BIMSTEC. Tangible results ensure credibility of our enterprise. Therefore, rationalizing the priority areas and concentrating on core economic areas such as connectivity, trade, tourism, energy, and agriculture is imperative. 
Connectivity is the enabler; energy is the locomotive; technology is the accelerator; investment and trade is the driver of regional growth and prosperity for bringing about structural as well as socio-economic transformation in the region. These transformative factors of regional growth and prosperity should top the BIMSTEC agenda from now onwards. They can be the game changer in our march to shared prosperity. 
Excellencies and Distinguished Delegates, 
Poverty remains a great challenge in our region. Poverty in one part of the region is a threat to prosperity everywhere in the region. We must eradicate it through the effective and timely implementation of the BIMSTEC Poverty Plan of Action in line with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. As the lead country, Nepal remains committed towards this end. 
Our region is one of the least integrated regions of the world in trade and physical connectivity despite the fact that not very long ago, the Bay of Bengal used to be a centre for global maritime trade, and a hub of commercial and cultural exchange. The Bay of Bengal was a linchpin between various cultures, societies and civilizations. 
Therefore, BIMSTEC should focus on re-vitalizing those links from the past, and on enabling the drivers of integration among the Member States. Negotiations on BIMSTEC Free Trade Agreement are yet to be concluded. Early conclusion and operationalizaion of all trade related instruments is critical for enhancing economic engagements in the region.
We must ensure a competitive incentive structure for our private sector to encourage them to trade and invest in the region. We must make the cost of non-trading in BIMSTEC higher. In this context, BIMSTEC economic and business forums should work together to this end.
It is a matter of satisfaction that a master-plan on transport connectivity is being developed to expand and upgrade connectivity in the region. Initiatives for grid interconnections will also be taken forward after signing of its MoU in this Summit in order to enhance region-wide energy cooperation. Energy trade must be placed in the agenda for further cooperation.
The Bay of Bengal region is vulnerable to climate change and natural disasters. We suffer disproportionately from the adverse impact of climate change. Ecological interdependence of our region from high mountains to deep seas calls for strong collaborative partnership amongst us.
Peace and stability is very important for development. Our region is not free form menace of terrorism and other transnational organized crimes. We have to work together to defeat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and combat other transnational crimes. 
Excellencies and Distinguished Delegates, 
We have to move from commitment to implementation phase. We must make BIMSTEC mechanisms functional and result-oriented. Secretariat must be strengthened with adequate resources.
Moving forward, I wish to touch upon three important areas for our consideration. 
First, growth and prosperity require tangible progress in trade integration, particularly early progress in the reduction of non-tariff barriers; streamlining regulatory frameworks and harmonization of standards. Trade and transit facilitations must be given top priority. TNC negotiations on all trade-related instruments must be concluded at the earliest.
Second, transport, energy and ICT connectivity must receive our top priority. We must work together closely to promote sustainable transport networks, sustainable energy and power grid interconnections, and information highways.
Last, we must address shared vulnerabilities and risks posed by natural disasters, food security and climate change. Resilient and innovative BIMSTEC is absolutely critical to sustaining momentum of growth dynamics, taking into account special circumstances and needs of LDCs and LLDCs.
For making progress in these areas, what we need is an enhanced level of political will. After all, a regional organization can flourish only with the stronger commitment of its Member States. 
Nepal attaches great importance to regional cooperation under BIMSTEC. It is one of our foreign policy priorities. 
I look forward to having a constructive and productive discussion today.
Please allow me to express my appreciation to our colleagues for their hard work both in the Special and Nineteenth Sessions of the BIMSTEC Senior Officials’ Meeting. 
I would also like to commend His Excellency Mr. M. Shahidul Islam, Secretary-General of BIMSTEC and his team for their utmost efforts for preparatory works of this Meeting. 
With these words, I conclude my opening remarks.
Thank you.

Remarks by Hon. Pradeep Kumar Gyawali, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Nepal as a Chief Guest at a Talk Programme on BIMSTEC: Connecting South and Southeast Asia organized by Centre for South Asian Studies (CSAS)
Kathmandu, 24 August 2018
 
Director of the Centre for South Asian Studies, Dear Dr. Nischal Nath Pandey Ji,
Distinguished Speakers,
Distinguished Guests, and
Ladies and Gentlemen
Namaste and Very Good Afternoon!
First of all, I would like to thank you, Dr. Pandey and CSAS family, for inviting me to this program and providing an opportunity to speak a few words in front of you all.
I would also like to commend Dr. Pandey and CSAS family for timely organization of this talk program on BIMSTEC: Connecting South and Southeast Asia. As we wind up our preparations for the 4th BIMSTEC Summit and its preceding meetings, the programs of this kind will certainly help enrich our understanding about BIMSTEC and its role as a bridge between South Asia and South-east Asia.  I believe today’s program has been an opportunity to deliberate on the realities and future priorities for the Bay of Bengal region.
As you all know the Fourth BIMSTEC Summit is being organized next week on the theme of ‘Towards a Peaceful, Prosperous and Sustainable Bay of Bengal Region’. This theme itself is an embodiment of the BIMSTEC member states’ lofty aspirations of peace, sustainable development and prosperity. I am confident that the Leaders will explore ways and means of realizing these common aspirations and chart out concrete actions in order to further strengthen and steer the BIMSTEC process towards these goals.
Dear Friends,
BIMSTEC region is bestowed with the abundance of natural, cultural and human resources. Nearly one-fourth of the world population lives in this region. The size of the economy of the region is over 3 trillion US Dollar and is growing annually at 6.5 percent. This is an evidence of the vast opportunities BIMSTEC possesses for greater regional cooperation and collaboration.
The region also possesses shared history, great civilizations and compelling potentials.  The region has a history of exchanges connecting peoples, societies and cultures since long before the advent of modern forces of globalization. Diversity in the region has always been an attribute that not just ‘divides and differentiates’ peoples, but on the contrary, binds them together as an enabler for mutual benefit and enrichment.
Dear friends, 
BIMSTEC region today faces old development challenges and it is not immune to new vulnerabilities. While we have to continue our fight against the ills of poverty, inequality, unemployment and disease, new problems such as climate change, terrorism, and transnational organized crimes demand our concerted efforts. These challenges cannot effectively be addressed through isolated domestic interventions alone. Therefore, we must find a collective and coordinated response to our common challenges and problems.
This is where the importance of regional cooperation under BIMSTEC is all the more important.
BIMSTEC, as a regional organization, was conceived to connect South Asia and South East Asia as a dynamic bridge. The vision was to connect South Asia which currently has a population 1.7 billion and 3.3 trillion US Dollar of GDP with South East Asia that has 643 million inhabitants and 2.76 trillion US Dollars of GDP.
BIMSTEC not only connects South and South-East Asia, it also links the ecologies of the Great Himalayas and the Bay of Bengal. The organic linkage between White Mountains of Himalayas and Blue Waters of the Bay of Bengal is a defining marker of BIMSTEC region.
Apart from geographic connectivity, BIMSTEC also possesses shared cultures, beliefs, religions and civilizations. The values of peace and non-violence preached by Buddha inspire the peoples living in the region. With shared values, histories, ways of life, and destinies that are interlinked, BIMSTEC represents a common space for peace and development.
The importance of BIMSTEC lies in connecting these two regions for the shared benefit and prosperity of the peoples of the Bay of Bengal region.
BIMSTEC is well positioned to make notable contributions towards advancing regional connectivity, linking SAARC and ASEAN. For a landlocked country like Nepal, BIMSTEC carries more significance. It bears the prospects for propelling economic growth by connecting the hinterlands of the Himalayas to the ports of Bay of Bengal.
This bridging aspiration is driven by the potential economic rewards of greater regional connectivity. By fostering intra-regional connectivity around the region, we promote trade and investment. Such inter-linkage of trade and investment will promote regional value chains to capitalize on our human and natural resources. The geographic linkages of the region will then be complemented by economic linkages.
The leverage South Asia and South East Asia have will dramatically increase once the two regions are well connected and better integrated through BIMSTEC. South Asia will find its way into and across the Pacific whereas South East Asia will have easier access to Central Asia and Europe.
Such economic linkages will further promote existing people-to-people relations among countries in the region. It will also instill the Bay of Bengal consciousness in people of the region who already share common cultures, values and beliefs.
I believe such connectivity and inter-linkages can truly transform the Bay of Bengal region into a peaceful, prosperous and sustainable region.
Dear Friends,
We must concede that BIMSTEC has not been able to live up to the expectations of the peoples of this region even after 20 years of its establishment. We are yet to make substantial progress in the issues of mutual interest such as trade and transit facility, physical and digital connectivity, infrastructure, and realization of free trade area. The peoples of this region are earnestly expecting BIMSTEC to deliver.
It is my firm conviction that we must work together with the concerted efforts to make BIMSTEC a deliverable organization. It’s high time we channelized our means and efforts towards implementing what we have agreed on. We must also stay focused and committed to develop new concrete actions to steer the BIMSTEC process more effectively.
I am confident that the upcoming BIMSTEC Summit will be instrumental in appropriately addressing relevant issues of mutual interest of the member states. After all, it is in the benefit of all peoples in the region to develop BIMSTEC as a vibrant and fulfilling organization connecting South and Southeast Asia.
I thank you all for your attention.

Remarks by The Hon’ble Pradeep Kumar Gyawali, Minister for Foreign Affairs, at a Get together Reception organized by Nepal Bharat Friendship Society to celebrate the 72nd Independence Day of India
Kathmandu, 16 August 2018
President of Nepal Bharat Friendship Society, Mr. Prem Lashkery,
Former Vice President Mr. Paramananda Jha,
Former Prime Minister Dr. Baburam Bhattarai,
Ambassador of India, H. E. Shri Manjeev Singh Puri,
Mayor of Kathmandu Metropolis Mr. Vidya Sundar Shakya,
Ladies and Gentlemen.
I am thankful to Nepal Bharat Friendship Society for inviting me to this event organized to commemorate the 72nd Independence Day of India. I feel honourd to be a part of this celebration. On this happy occasion, I would like to extend my warm greetings to Ambassador Puri and through him to the Government and people of India. I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate them for the remarkable achievements made by India over the last seven decades of freedom from the colonial rule. 
Ladies and Gentlemen,
This day reminds us of a glorious moment of triumph on the 15th of August 1947 which not only brought to an end the dark era of repression in India, but also generated an inspiration for the peoples around the world for freedom and self-rule. It also demonstrated that peace and non-violence would be the best way to win freedom. Today as India is celebrating its historic Independence Day, we pay our tribute to the apostle of non-violence, the great Mahatma Gandhi. 
In this context, let me recall the whole-hearted support extended by the people of Nepal for freedom movement of India and active participation of some of our prominent leaders like B.P. Koirala, Man Mohan Adhikari and Krishna Prasad Bhattarai of the time in it. Our leaders fought shoulder to shoulder with their Indian friends to liberate India from colonial rule. 
Today, a firm commitment to the principles of peaceful coexistence, sovereign equality, mutual respect and understanding of each other’s aspirations and interests and respect of each other’s sensitivities characterize our relations and should continue to do so. Age-old ties of history, culture, tradition and religion have nurtured our relations. The spheres of our cooperation have expanded into extensive partnerships in multiple areas of common interest at bilateral, regional and international levels. India’s cooperation in infrastructure development, human resource development and projects in much needed sectors such as hydropower development has been instrumental in our efforts to achieve socio-economic transformation of the country. Besides recognizing the catalytic role of connectivity in stimulating economic growth and promoting people-to-people contacts, we focus our attention on advancing cooperation in water resources, strengthening trade and economic linkages, and promoting religious and cultural ties, to name a few. 
Ladies and Gentlemen,
This day also brings to our mind the steady journey of India since August 1947 towards the consolidation of national independence and institutionalization of a firm democratic foundation. India has shown to the world how democracy and development could be advanced simultaneously to promote overall progress and prosperity of the people. 
The achievements India has made in the last 71 years of independence are truly inspiring. India stands firmly at the forefront, among other nations, with its distinct position in economic development, social progress, and scientific and technological advancement. A population of 1.3 billion consisting mostly of young, innovative and enterprising section has been a great dividend. India’s economic growth rate has been high over the years. India’s IT sector remains one of the best in the world. It is making great strides in space research. The rapid building of infrastructure, expansion of trade and increase in agriculture productivity have transformed the country’s destiny. 
Nonetheless, there are many challenges. And our challenges are similar in many respects. Both our countries are not fully free from poverty, illiteracy, disease, food insecurity and insufficient infrastructure. The vast natural resources that we have been gifted with are yet to be properly harnessed. Economic interlinkages are yet to be consolidated. We are yet to benefit fully from mutual complementarity in many other areas. All these necessitate further efforts for a meaningful partnership so as to ensure mutually beneficial results. 
In this context, I fondly recall the exchange of visits by the Prime Ministers of Nepal and India in April and May this year which has generated a new dynamism in our bilateral relations. Our two sides are committed to taking bilateral relations to newer heights by strengthening ongoing cooperation in diverse spheres as well as to expanding partnership on the basis of the principles of equality, mutual trust, respect and mutual benefit. Besides economic, social and other areas of cooperation, we are expanding cooperation in the core areas of agriculture, railway linkages and inland waterways. While focusing on effective implementation of all the past agreements and understandings, both sides have intensified engagements for addressing the outstanding matters within the stipulated time frame of September 2018 with the objective of advancing cooperation in all areas. 
Likewise, we are expecting the final report of the EPG-NIR to be submitted soon which, I believe, will suggest a clear guideline for the excellent relations between our countries as required for the 21st century.
In view of such focused attention from both sides on deeper and wider engagements in the areas of common interest, we look forward to a mutually beneficial outcome for our two countries and peoples. 
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Once again, I would like to express my best wishes for the continued progress and prosperity of the people of India on this occasion. I also wish this get together reception a success.
Before I conclude, I pray for early recovery and good health of Shri Atal Bihari Bajpai ji the veteran, esteemed and renowned leader and good friend of Nepal. 
Thank you.

Statement by The Hon’ble Pradeep Kumar Gyawali, Minister for Foreign Affairs at the function organized by Nepal-Pakistan Friendship and Cultural Association to celebrate the 71st Anniversary of the Independence of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan
14 August 2018
Rt. Hon. Vice-President,
Mr. Himalaya Shumsher Rana, President of Nepal-Pakistan Friendship and Cultural Association
His Excellency Dr. Mazhar Javed, Ambassador of Pakistan
Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
It gives me great pleasure to attend this special function organized by Nepal-Pakistan Friendship and Cultural Association to celebrate the 71st Anniversary of the Independence of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. While expressing my sincere appreciation to the Association for this initiative, I would like to extend warm congratulations and best wishes to the Government and the friendly people of Pakistan on this happy occasion. I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Pakistani people for successful conduct of the recent general elections in Pakistan in a democratic way. We look forward to working closely with the new government. 
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I am happy to note that ever since the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1960, Nepal and Pakistan have been enjoying cordial and friendly relations characterized by goodwill, mutual understanding and cooperation. Our two countries have been working together at bilateral, regional and international levels to promote mutual interest. Enhanced engagement in the political, economic, cultural and other spheres would further strengthen relations between our two countries and peoples.
There is no doubt that the exchange of visits at high level immensely contributes to further strengthening bilateral relations. In particular, I would like to fondly recall the official visit of the Prime Minister of Pakistan to Nepal in March this year which provided both sides with the opportunity to discuss various matters of mutual cooperation. The visit also held special significance as it was the first one by a foreign head of government after the formation of the present government in Nepal. 
As neighbours in South Asia, Nepal and Pakistan share common aspirations for the socio-economic development of our peoples. However, many common developmental challenges confront us in this quest. In order to address such challenges and fulfill our aspirations, there is a need to explore more avenues of deeper cooperation in the coming days. 
A peaceful, stable and prosperous South Asia is in our interest. As a common platform, SAARC can play a pivotal role in advancing prosperity in the region. What we need to do is to revitalize SAARC. We must make it an organization that delivers tangible outcome. Without deeper integration we cannot enjoy the fruits of regional cooperation. To achieve results, we must focus on core areas of trade, investment, tourism, and connectivity. Nepal always remains proactive in realizing the objectives enshrined in the SAARC Charter and as the current Chair has been working closely with Member States in the spirit of solidarity, cooperation and partnership.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Sustainable economic growth and social development are perquisite to enhance the quality of life of our people. In this context, a meaningful and mutually beneficial engagement between Nepal and Pakistan holds significance. We have good potential in furthering mutual benefit in economic sphere. The current figure of bilateral trade is not reflective of the vast potentials that we possess. In order to further promote economic cooperation, enhanced focus should be laid on strengthening existing mechanisms and simplifying enabling regulations. We also need to ensure holding regular meetings of the joint mechanisms to explore and realize the potentials of further trade, investment, and industrial joint ventures. 
It is worth mentioning that there is enormous possibility of further cooperation in the areas of agriculture and tourism between Nepal and Pakistan. More exchanges in the cultural field would help deepen people-to-people relations. Importantly, Nepali students have benefited from higher studies in Pakistan. Seats provided by the Government of Pakistan for medical education have been of great support in building our manpower in this crucial field. 
As we explore the possibility of enhancing bilateral economic engagements, the active role of the private sector remains important. At the same time, the mechanisms and linkages established between the business communities of our two countries need to be revitalized. 
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I am privileged to reiterate that Nepal attaches high importance to its relations with Pakistan. As we strive for deeper and wider bilateral relations, we look forward to continued cooperation and exchanges at different levels in coming days for the mutual benefit of the two countries and peoples. 
Once again, I would like to express my best wishes for the continued progress and prosperity of the people of Pakistan on this auspicious day. 
Thank you.

Statement by Minister for Foreign Affairs, Hon. Mr. Pradeep Kumar Gyawali, at the Launching Ceremony of the “SAWTEE Centre for Sustainable Development” (SAWTEE-CSD)
Kathmandu, 06 August 2018 
Vice Chairman of National Planning Commission, Honourable Prof. Dr. Pushpa Raj Kadel,
Former Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr. Prakash Sharan Mahat,
Dr. Posh Raj Pandey ji, Chairman of South Asia Watch on Trade, Economics and Environment (SAWTEE),
Former High Representative for the LDCs, LLDCs and SIDS, Gyan Chandra Acharya ji,
Excellencies,
Friends from the media,
Ladies and Gentlemen.
I feel honoured to be amongst you this afternoon at the Launching Ceremony of the SAWTEE Centre for Sustainable Development (SAWTEE-CSD).
I congratulate SAWTEE and its pioneers for establishing the Centre for Sustainable Development. I also congratulate Gyan Chandra Acharya ji for leading the Centre and wish for its success. Someone who was in a position to advocate the cause of LDCs and LLDCs during the negotiation of Sustainable Development Goals, this is a fitting job that Gyan Chandra ji has chosen to undertake.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
As the distinguished former speakers have shed light on different elements of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), I wish to limit myself to share my perspectives on some of the critical areas that are important for us.
The SDGs represent the most comprehensive development agendas ever evolved through consensus of the world community. Adoption of this in 2015 reflected the resolve of humanity to fight poverty and extricate itself from the state of under-development.
This bears a special meaning to the least developed countries like Nepal. It has generated enormous hope in LDCs as this represents the most holistic development promise to them ever since the vulnerabilities and special needs of the group was recognized in 1971.
The SDGs build on the achievements of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) but encompass much more than that. For LDCs and LLDCs, SDGs represent the substantial addition to the MDGs, Istanbul Program of Action (IPOA), the Vienna Program of Action (VPOA), Addis Ababa Action Agenda and other internationally agreed development goals and targets.
While all the earlier efforts have made positive contributions in bringing shared understanding, shared commitment as well as visible improvement in the human condition, SDGs aim at leaving no one behind and taking forward everyone in this journey.
Through the implementation of cross-cutting 17 goals and 169 indicators, SDGs intend to culminate in ending poverty and hunger from the face of the world. This is ambitious but through our collective efforts it is achievable. We must start this journey from the local and national level.
Nepal remains committed to achieve these goals before 2030. Building on our experience and relative success in the implementation of MDGs, the Government of Nepal has fully internalized the SDGs into the national policies and plans. It is imperative now to mainstream and integrate them in the provincial and local level plans and programmes. We were the first country to prepare national plan of action for SDGs. Nepal participated in Voluntary National Review at the High Level Political Forum last year and we are preparing for the next year’s review of the progress after 4 years of the SDGs’ adoption.
Implementation of SDGs is critical for Nepal’s ambition of graduating from the LDC status. Progress in SDGs can contribute for smooth and sustainable graduation as we endeavour to raise our performance in income criteria.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
After years of political transition, Nepal has now achieved political stability. The conflict had its toll in terms of a generation of youth flying from the country and remaining outside of the school. We invested our valuable time, enormous political capital, economic resources and that of people’s resilience to conclude the peace process. This has established culture of dialogue and accommodation among the stakeholders within the country, which is manifested in the promulgation of a democratic and inclusive constitution in 2015. This has also raised people’s expectation.
One of the biggest challenges of our time is ending poverty which is the overarching goal of the SDGs. The government intends to address this situation by aligning targeted programs with economic, social and environmental pillars of the SDGs. The recently pronounced policies and programs of the government and the federal budget for this fiscal year are aimed at fulfilling that objective and building foundation for making “Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali”.
Nepal has abundant natural resources. We have potential to meet our energy needs and generate resources for other development purposes by tapping hydropower potential. Geographical proximity to India and China provides Nepal a unique opportunity to benefit from unprecedented economic transformation taking place there that opens up immense opportunities for trade and investment.
In order to realise SDGs, Nepal needs to attain higher productivity and economic growth. Promotion of innovation, entrepreneurship, manufacturing, and the small and medium-sized enterprises can play critical role in this process. Nepal also needs to focus on capacity building and infrastructure development.
As a least developed country, Nepal has to invest its limited resources with great prudence. Agriculture is the largest contributor in national GDP. Majority of our population lives in rural areas and depends on agriculture for livelihoods. However, for agriculture to be an attractive enterprise for younger generation, we need to modernise it, encourage commercial farming, and search market access for agro-products.
Dear Friends,
Progress on all of the SDGs will be stalled if women’s empowerment is not put at the top of the agenda. Realization of gender equality hinges upon the full empowerment of women and girls. So is the importance of ensuring inclusion of marginalized communities and the Dalits in the mainstream of the development process and render social justice to all of our people. The Constitution of Nepal has guaranteed gender equality and equal rights for all. Investing in education is the call of our time. Providing technical and vocational training and creating job should be our priority. Quality and inclusive education has the capacity to bring positive social and economic transformation in the country. Our own experience of inclusiveness has proved this reality.
Our demography is young but lacks modern skills. Finding decent jobs for them at a time when the world is witnessing the fourth Industrial Revolution is a challenge for us. For over a decade, migration and by extension remittance has remained a major component of our economy. Nepal attaches great value in ensuring safe, orderly and regular migration. We have stressed on creating a fair and win-win situation for all, including the migrant workers. At domestic level, we are pursuing this matter in earnest and are committed to eradicate all forms of labour related issues by 2028.
The cost of natural disasters is rising sharply in terms of human tragedy and devastation. Nepal is one of the most vulnerable countries in terms of natural disasters. The pain of earthquake in 2015 has not fully subsided yet which resulted in pushing 2% of our population into poverty. Nepal disproportionately suffers from climate change despite its negligible contribution in greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore it has been our endeavour to implementthe Paris Agreement in line with the spirit of 2030 Agenda. At international level, we call for the common but differentiated responsibilities, equity and respective capabilities should be at the centre of its implementation.
Rule-based international trading system has potential to create win-win situation for all if it is implemented with special but differentiated treatment to the LDCs and LLDCs. Nepal has identified its major export items and devised strategies to address trading and competitiveness challenges faced by export sector. We intend to address the constraints of institutional capacity, trade and investment promotion, trade facilitation, intellectual property rights, and issues related to trade in services. Reducing the trade deficit is of paramount importance. Identifying new sources of exports and reducing the cost of exporting goods has been our priority.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
As a shared commitment, the Government of Nepal has started the process of effective implementation of SDGs. However, our effort alone will not be enough. Realization of the most ambitious goals will remain elusive in absence of the means of implementation. There exists a gap between the ambition and the resource commitment internationally. It calls for multi-pronged approach and solid international partnership. We need reliable and sustainable financing and technology transfer to overcome capacity and structural impediments. Developing multi-stakeholder partnership to share knowledge, expertise, technology, and financial support is seen as critical to overall success of the SDGs. Public-private and civil society partnership as well as timely and full implementation of the IPOA, VPOA, and Addis Ababa Action Agenda in full synergy and coherence with the 2030 Agenda are equally important.
Implementing SDGs is a collective responsibility of all stakeholders including the non-governmental actors. All out efforts from our partners within the country and outside through investment in the activities that directly contribute to propelling growth and economic development are required to bring a change in the ground. Nepal faces development challenges in all fronts. This requires sustained investments and complementary efforts from all fronts to yield concrete results in the ground. I hope the CDS that is being launched today would play its role in this effort.
The Government of Nepal welcomes the contribution from civil society partners and is keen to join hands with all stakeholders in our journey to achieving the Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development.
With these words, I conclude my remarks.
I thank you all for your attention.

Statement by Hon. Minister for Foreign Affairs at the 70th Anniversary Program of NCWA
Posted onAugust 3, 2018August 3, 2018 

Remarks by the Minister for Foreign Affairs Honourable Pradeep Kumar Gyawali at the 70th Anniversary Program of Nepal Council of World Affairs
Kathmandu, 03 August 2018
Mr. Chairman and the office bearers of the Nepal Council of World Affairs,
Excellencies, 
Friends from the Media,
Ladies and Gentlemen.


I feel privileged to address this august gathering organized to mark the 70th anniversary of Nepal Council of World Affairs.
I would like to congratulate the Council and its office bearers on its 70th anniversary and extend my best wishes for the continued success and progress of the Council as an important policy forum. I thank you all for inviting me to be part of this occasion.
The Council probably is the oldest think-tank in Nepal to deliberate on foreign policy and other issues of global concerns. There was a time when everyone would look upon the Council to host talks of distinguished foreign dignitaries or deliberate on the pertinent issues of foreign relations that bear importance to Nepal. While it is a matter of satisfaction to see the Council surviving for 70 long years, it is also befitting to expect the Council thriving both in terms of quality of deliberations and inclusiveness in its membership. The Council should be able to attract interests among the young and dynamic generation for it to further grow and contribute to fulfill its founding objectives.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

As guided by the Constitution of Nepal, the principles of the UN Charter, Panchasheel, international law and the norms of world peace continue to inspire the conduct of our foreign policy. We pursue an independent foreign policy based on our national interest. Friendship with all and animosity with none has remained the hallmark of our engagements in the comity of nations. Sovereign equality, mutuality of interest, justice and mutual respect provide the basis for the conduct of our international relations. Informed by these universally accepted norms of inter-state relations, we have steadily expanded our diplomatic outreach to 161 countries of the world that constitutes over 80 percent of UN membership.
The present Government attaches high importance to the socio-economic development of the country which is key to sustaining peace and stability, and enhancing quality of life of our people. Our desire to attain a decent level of prosperity in short run and sustaining of the gains for longer term development of the country is informed by the need and aspiration of our people for achieving economic transformation in our own life time. This resolve of the nation is well reflected in the policy and programs of the Government for the current fiscal year which is aimed at building a foundation for the coming five years.
With a view to realize those objectives, it has been our priority to mobilize all the resources at our disposal, including our diplomatic apparatus. We have emphasized on promoting economic development agendas through strategic pursuit of economic diplomacy. Garnering international support for economic development and promoting foreign direct investment, tourism, technology transfer, and export trade are some of the important areas that we would like our diplomatic machinery to focus on to complement the national development objective.

Dear Friends, 

Nepal’s neighborhood provides opportunities for expanding economic linkages. We enjoy cordial and friendly relations with both of our immediate neighbors. We continue to build mutual trust and goodwill and promote cooperative relations with them. Regular exchange of high level visits and increasing people to people contacts have further strengthened these relations and deepened the spirit of cooperation. Nepal stands committed not to allow her soil to be used by any undesired element against the interest of our neighbors and we expect similar sensitivity accorded by our neighbors on the maters of our concern.
Nepal and India enjoy historically close and multi-faceted relations. These relations are nurtured by extensive people level contacts and socio-cultural bonds that we share for centuries. The exchange of visits by the Prime Ministers of Nepal and India in April and May this year has contributed to further enhance mutual trust and consolidate bilateral relations. Our two countries are committed to take forward cooperation and partnership on the basis of equality, mutual trust, respect and mutual benefit. We have agreed to advance cooperation in the core areas of agriculture, railway linkages and inland waterways. While focusing on effective implementation of all the past agreements and understandings, we have intensified engagements for addressing the outstanding matters by September 2018. The bilateral oversight mechanism established in September 2016 has proved to be a useful means to accelerate the progress in the implementation of development projects and address the issues that come up during the process. The Eminent Persons Group has concluded its mandated task and we are anticipating submission of the report soon.
Nepal and China enjoy a long history of close and cordial relationship, which is based on the five principles of peaceful co-existence. Appreciation of each other’s aspirations as well as respect for each other’s concerns and sensitivities has injected an important element of trust in our relationship. Nepal remains fully committed to one China policy. We admire China’s neighborhood diplomacy guided by the principles of sincerity, amity, mutual benefit and inclusiveness.
The recent official visit to China by the Right Honourable Prime Minister of Nepal remained fruitful in further strengthening the friendly relations. We have agreed to intensify implementation of MoU on cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative to enhance connectivity. The cooperation covers building of dry ports, roads, railways, aviation and communications network within the framework of Trans-Himalaya Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network. We believe that this will open up a new era of cross-border cooperation and foster trade, commerce and investment.
Equally important is our relations with the friendly countries in our extended neighborhood and the labour receiving countries. We have been closely working together and engaged extensively with these important partners for the safety, security and well being of our migrant workers. We are keen to expand this relationship in the broader areas of economic partnership to promote trade, tourism, investment and people to people contacts for mutual benefit. Nepal also currently chairs the Colombo Process, a Regional Consultative Process on migration comprising 12 Asian labour sending countries. Nepal’s emphasis continues to be on the issues related to decent work, ethical recruitment, welfare of migrants including female workers, consular support and cooperation, financial literacy, and labor market assessment.
Nepal’s extended neighborhood also manifests itself through regional organizations such as SAARC and BIMSTEC. As you are well aware, Nepal is the current chair of both these organizations and continues to work together with fellow Member States to further accelerate these regional processes for achieving regional economic cooperation. Nepal is hosting the 4th BIMSTEC Summit towards the end of this month. We are engaged with other Member States to revive the stalled SAARC process. Our association with the Asian Cooperation Dialogue (ACD) has allowed us to be linked with our friends stretching all sub-regions of Asia. We are seeking observer status in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) to which we are a dialogue partner now. These regional bonds have kept growing and we believe that together with our bilateral initiatives, they will help us in our pursuit of economic development and prosperity.
Our relations with our development partners have been a very important part of our foreign relations. We attach high importance to our relations with the permanent members of the UN Security Council, the European Union and its member States, and our traditional donor and development partners. This relationship has remained cordial and cooperative both in bilateral fronts as well as in multilateral arena. Some of these partners have been the longest companions of our journey to economic development and modernization. We are grateful for their steadfast support and cooperation over the years, and we expect enhanced level of economic partnership to drive our mission of economic development and prosperity. We believe that there is a tremendous potential for expanding partnership in the areas of trade, investment and technology transfer. We have a common understanding with our development partners to multiply the existing success stories of development cooperation through the alignment of development assistance with our national priorities and to build synergetic effects in development. It has been our common goal to ensure that development assistance provides desired results.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Nepal remains actively engaged in the multilateral arena, including at the United Nations. Our faith in the principles and purposes of the UN Charter is unwavering and our belief in multilateralism remains consistent. We consider United Nations as an indispensible organization to deliberate upon and resolve the global issues of common concern. We support the UN reform initiatives to provide equal emphasis on all three pillars- peace and security, development and human rights, and to make the world body more efficient, effective and responsive to the need of our time. We continue to maintain principled and independent position on major issues of global concern. We support total and complete disarmament, especially of all weapons of mass destruction. We condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. We support peaceful settlement of all international disputes and consider diplomacy and dialogue as the most legitimate means of reducing differences and resolving conflicts. We continue to firmly support the Paris Convention on Climate Change. As a member of the World Trade Organization, we stand in support of rule-based international trading system with special and differentiated treatment to the LDCs and LLDCs in particular. We consider the relevance and importance of the non-aligned movement as a principle continues even today.
Nepal has contributed to the maintenance of international peace and security through its effective participation in UN mandated peacekeeping operations for past six decades. Currently, Nepal stands 6thlargest troop and police contributing country to the UN peace operations. The ultimate sacrifice made by 73 of our brave peacekeepers in the line of duty exemplifies our commitment to the cause of world peace. Nepali peacekeepers have proven their competence as the most professional and dedicated savior of peace and humanitarian protection. To reinforce our commitment to the protection of civilians, we have endorsed the Kigali principles and have joined the UN Secretary General’s Voluntary Compact against Sexual Exploitation and Abuse.
Besides contributing to UN peace operations, Nepal has its own unique experience of peaceful transformation from armed conflict to peace and democracy. Our uniquely successful, nationally owned and home-grown peace process provides a case study for countries in transition and those going through conflict. The Constitution of Nepal which incorporates the most progressive provisions of social justice, inclusive democracy and fundamental rights is the outcome of that successful peace process. Our experience can be useful for them how a nationally owned peace process can lead to a success. We are keen to share this unique experience for the benefit of larger humanity.
Nepal’s active advocacy for the cause of LDCs, LLDCs and SIDS and our solidarity and co-operation with these countries remain important part of our multilateral engagements. Under UN’s initiative, Nepal Chaired and led the 4th LDC Conference in Istanbul in 2011. Nepal remains steadfast in its calls for the effective implementation of all relevant international agreements to address the specific development needs of the countries in special situation.
We have set a goal of graduating from the LDC status at the earliest feasible time. The triennial review conducted by the UN Committee on Development Policy has concluded that Nepal meets two out of three criteria for the graduation. We are committed to raise the third and the most important criteria, the per capita income, to a decent level so that we could steer through the graduation in a smooth and sustainable manner.
Nepal actively contributed to the negotiation of sustainable development goals (SDG). We were the first country to prepare national plan of action for their implementation. We have fully aligned our national development plans with the SDGs to comprehensively address the issues of poverty and under-development and not to leave anyone behind in the process.

Dear Friends,

Our commitment to democracy, pluralism and the universal values of human rights and fundamental freedoms is unwavering. Those were the ideals for which we fought for seven decades. We hold them dear and do not ‘take them for granted’. This commitment is translated in our role in the Human Rights Council, where we remain a member for the term 2018-20 and have also announced our bid for re-election to the Council. Nepal’s role at the Council reflects our position for apolitical and objective examination of human rights issues on non-selective, even-handed and merit basis. We stand for a system that is transparent, accountable and embraces universally accepted democratic values.
Nepal is a party to 24 international human rights related instruments, and 7 out of 9 core human rights instruments. We continue to faithfully engage with the relevant human rights mechanisms such as the UPR process and the Special Procedures mechanism and treaty bodies. Given the level of economic development and capacity of the country, our undertaking of international human rights obligations remains among the top. We consider that by attaining economic development and providing means for implementation of human rights obligations can substantially enable the enjoyment of human rights by all.
As you all are aware that we have just come out of long and painful conflict and protracted peace process. As we are focused in the reconciliation and healing process of the post-conflict society, we are equally sensitive and committed to avoidance of impunity and ensure justice to the victims.

Finally,

Before I conclude, let me put on record my appreciation to the Nepal Council of World Affairs in bringing out its Annual Journal, which I am sure will provide valuable insights on various contemporary issues. I congratulate all those involved in this useful endeavor.

I thank you all for your attention.

Distinguished Friends
Ladies and Gentlemen
I am really delighted to attend this ceremony on the handover of the Israeli “Wheel Chairs of Hope”being organised by the Embassy of Israel in Kathmandu together with Lions Club of Kathmandu Capital District 325-A2 and Karuna Foundation Nepal to mark the 70 Years of Independence of the State of Israel. On this occasion, on behalf of the Government of Nepal, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as well as on my own, I would like to extend by heartiest congratulations to the Government and the people of the State of Israel and wish for continued peace and progress of the people of the State of Israel.
The six-decades of partnership and cooperation between Nepal and Israel has been immensely fruitful and productive in the development efforts of Nepal. I feel glad to note that Nepal was the first country in South Asia to have the diplomatic relations with the State of Israel. Over the years, our bilateral engagements and cooperation have been growing incessantly with renewed strength every year which ultimately is in the interest of our two countries and people.  The exchange of high level visits between the two countries beginning from 1960s and mutually beneficial cooperative relations in the diverse fields including agriculture and irrigation, human resource development, science and technology, tourism and civil aviation and foreign employment   have brought our two countries and people closer to each other.
Let me take this opportunity to restate that Government and the people of Nepal highly regard the humanitarian support and solidarity extended by the Government and people of the State of Israel during the devastating earthquakes in April 2015. We had received a humanitarian mission of over 250 Doctors, much needed for rescue and relief operations, sent immediately after the earthquake by the Government of Israel.
After my assumption of office as the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Nepal, we made an arrangement for hosting the First meeting of the Bilateral Consultation Mechanism (BCM) between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the two friendly countries in Kathmandu in March 2018 at the senior officer’s level.  Matters of bilateral and mutual interests were thoroughly discussed on that occasion. Following the BCM meeting in Nepal, there has also been a ministerial level visit to Israel in the recent past.
I would like to appreciate Your Excellency the Ambassador and the Embassy of Israel in Kathmandu for coming up with this idea of supporting the children with disabilities in Nepal and co- organizing this event to that effect. I take this event as a symbolic gesture of empathy and support to our children. I would also like to congratulate the other two co- organisers- the Lions Club of Kathmandu Capital District 325-A and the Karuna Foundation Nepal for the initiatives you have taken for addressing the concerns of the children with disabilities in Nepal. I am sure the ‘’Wheelchairs of Hope” will bring about a new ray of hope and aspiration to our young children with disabilities for realizing their full potential in the society they are living in. The philanthropic activities of this kind do matter significantly when it comes to changing the future of our children who need additional support. In that sense this is an exemplary initiative on the part of the organisers.
I have a firm belief that everyone is born with a unique and special ability. Physical disability cannot and should not be a permanent obstacle to the progress and development of our children in their lives. It is essential that the government agencies, private sector, civil society, academia and all other segments of society work hand in hand to change social attitude towards disability and ensure favourable environment for all round development of our children with disabilities. We need to create conditions in which they are entitled special opportunities and facilities so that they can reach their full potential. Their voices need to be heard and their rights need to be ensured in the society.
It goes without saying that our future rests on the hands of our children. The government of Nepal, realising this fact,is fully committed to increase the access of our children with disabilities to education, medical services and skill development activities. Decade-long conflict, inadequate physical infrastructure causing serious accidents and lack of enough health facility is contributing to add on the problem. Our objective is to make sure that disability stops being a perennial source of pain and suffering. There are ample examples in which children with disabilities through their persistent efforts, hard work, and perseverance have brought remarkable changes to their societies by the time they reached their adulthood.Children,however, need support and protection to set such examples.I am confident that our policies and programmes, our strong desire and commitment coupled with revolutionary changes brought about by science and technology would herald a new dawn in the lives of the children with disabilities in the time to come.
The Constitution of Nepal has enshrined the right to equality and non-discrimination as fundamental rights of all citizens.The Government of Nepal adopted various schemes and programmes that include social security allowance, Community Based Rehabilitation (CBR), and reservation quotas to enable persons with disability live with dignity and honour in community. The Government has been making efforts to increase enrollment of children with disabilities in school with the provision of different types of scholarships and incentives.The Coordinating efforts by government, civil societies community and the concerning family are extremely important.
At the moment near about 77000 children with disabilities have been enrolled in school education system out of which about 65000 children with disability are in basic education school (Grade 1 to 8).
Before I conclude, I would once again like to extend my sincere thanks to the Embassy of Israel in Kathmandu for materialising this event today and providing me this opportunity to be part of a noble cause as the Chief Guest. Being a father of the daughter with physical and mental disability, I feel emotionally attached to such programmes and community. Let me reiterate that the event today is the reflection of the subsistingstrong bond of friendship,understanding and cooperation between Nepal and the State of Israel which have been growing steadily towards the mutual satisfaction of our two countries. My sincere appreciation also goes to two other organisers- the Lions Club of Kathmandu Capital District 325 -A2 and Karuna Foundation Nepal.
Finally, let me express my hope that this is not the end of journey of philanthropic activities that benefit our children with disabilities. I look forward to be part of many more initiatives like this in the future.
I thank you all.

Statement by Minister for Foreign Affairs, Hon. Mr. Pradeep Kumar Gyawali, at the Talk Program on “Nepal and United Nations: Partners for Peace and Development” organized by United Nations Association of Nepal
Kathmandu, 12 July 2018 
Mr. Chairman,
Excellencies,
Colleagues from the media,
Ladies and Gentlemen.
I feel honored to be amongst you this afternoon. I would like to thank the organizers for inviting me to this forum.
Discourses on the pertinent themes like that of today are always useful. I found the theme aptly chosen and relevant. I hope the United Nation’s Association of Nepal will continue such discussions in the future as well. Let me directly enter into the topic of today and share my thoughts on this.
The ideals of sovereign equality, peace, justice, and progress espoused by the UN Charter continue to inspire us. Nepal has an abiding faith and commitment to the principles and purposes of the UN Charter. Nepal’s constitution recognizes them as the guiding elements of our foreign policy.
It is close to seven decades, even before Nepal became its member, Nepal and the United Nations began partnership for development. It all began at a time when Nepal had just emerged from centuries of isolation and the country needed expertise and technical know-how to steer through the path of openness, development and modernization. Those experts that came to Nepal in early 1950s under the UN technical assistance represent the early incarnation of UN’s partnership in the development of Nepal. That partnership has steadily grown and extended to the present.
After we became member of the United Nations in 1955 our partnership and engagements increased manifold and we have remained a dedicated and active member of the organization. Ever since, this partnership has grown, expanded and developed to include wide range of thematic areas and geographical coverage of Nepal.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Nepal’s partnership with the United Nations permeates to all three pillars of the organization, i.e. development, peace and security, and human rights. Let me briefly touch on each of them.
Nepal’s association with the UN and contribution to different UN specialized agencies has been long, constructive and fruitful. Some of the UN specialized agencies that are there in the governance of international public goods and cross-border regulation of communications and air transportation have been partner in their respective fields ever since we became the member of these agencies.
In the development front, we have been partners in increasing the coverage of vaccination, controlling disease, improving maternal and child health, reducing child and maternal mortality, and improving hygiene and sanitation. Our collaboration with the UN continues in expanding literacy, increasing enrollment of children into schools, reducing drop outs, improving girl’s education and increasing women’s participation and empowerment. These efforts have contributed for bringing marked change in the human and social development indicators and achieving the MDGs and SDGs. UN’s cooperation in the eradication of malaria, leprosy, tuberculosis and controlling of pandemics and epidemics has remained significant. UN has been partner in disaster preparedness, mitigation and response, and we have worked together to reduce vulnerabilities, enhance resilience and protect environment.
UN funds and programs like UNDP has been a partner for development and the face of UN in Nepal for decades. We have received UN’s assistance for management of refugee population for years. We have received relief services and food aid in time of disasters and emergencies, and humanitarian assistance to the refugee population. UN has been assisting us in the provision of food for work in remote areas to cope with food shortage and nutrition problem as well as in the building of local level infrastructures. UN agencies support extends to the conservation and preservation of natural and man-made heritage sites. They have been partner for promoting social dialogue and decent job. We have received technical assistance and capacity building for the modernization and improvement of agriculture sector and assistance in fulfilling critical resource gap in that process.
UN has brought new ideas and technical expertise in development process. Its partnership in improving human development indicators and implementation of MDGs was significant in the past. Our partnership with the UN has now transitioned to the focused implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). UN has been a key partner in that process to help us achieve the goals as per the national development plans and priorities.
In this spirit, last year Nepal stressed on the need to evolve United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) through a genuine consultative process of the Government stakeholders, and make UNDAF a true outcome of a country-owned and country-led process so that it could help attain its objectives. Nepal’s assertion to make that important document a broad-based and country-owned emanates from our desire to bring a requisite focus to those SDGs that are critically important for Nepal to achieve in the short run so that a solid base could be created for the attainment of the rest.
Building on our relative success of the implementation of the MDGs, it has been our priority to implement and achieve the 17 goals and 169 targets of the SDGs before 2030. We have taken some concrete steps to that direction. We have fully internalized them into our national policies and plans. They are now being implemented in earnest. This entails a massive mobilization of resources, and requires unique technical capacity. Our partnership with the UN in the coming years would be to marshalling of our combined resources and capacity towards achieving those goals. Poverty alleviation remains the overarching goal of the SDGs and through that we can collectively consolidate peace and development cherished by our people for long.
In this regard, we are encouraged by the adoption of the resolution 72/279 by the UNGA in May this year. The resolution carries a fundamental repositioning of UN development system in decades. This is intended for robust implementation of SDGs where the country concerned is at the centre of the entire process. We look forward to the impending repositioning that is aimed at addressing the gaps, building synergy and improving accountability, steering clear from the politicization of development. With the new system in place, we anticipate carrying forward of the implementation of all SDGs with equal emphasis and priority so that a balanced and an evenly process of development could be achieved.
As you all know, the Government has outlined ‘Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali’ as its overarching development goal. The recently pronounced policies and programs of the Government and the budget statement for the next fiscal year are aimed at attaining of that goal. While we are aware that there is an enormous task ahead, we seek cooperation of our partners, including from the UN system, for an enhanced level of economic partnership.
Dear Friends,
Maintaining international peace and security is the major objective of the United Nations. Nepal on its part has been contributing to the fulfillment of this objective for decades. True to our commitment to the principles of the UN Charter, we started contributing to the UN mandated peacekeeping operations just three years after Nepal joined this world body. This is the 60th year of Nepal’s participation in the UN peace operations. Ever since, over one hundred and thirty-five thousand Nepali peacekeepers have provided best of their services to over 42 different peace operation missions around the world. In the process, seventy-three Nepali peacekeepers have made ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty. Nepal currently stands 6th largest troop and police contributing country to the UN peacekeeping.
With its steadfast commitment to global peace, Nepal has remained a dependable and enduring partner in the UN peacekeeping operations often taking responsibilities in some of the most challenging situations. Nepal has never let the request of the UN down even at the shortest of calls. We have shown flexibility for inter-mission relocation of troops, deployed our officials in most difficult and challenging missions in terms of safety and security and have been fulfilling our commitment even during the period of internal conflict at home.
The fame and repute of Nepali peacekeepers as the most competent, dutiful and dependable peacekeepers has been further enhanced by Nepal’s participation in such operations without national caveats. This has allowed the United Nations the much needed ground level operational flexibilities to significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the peace operations and fulfill its mandates.
Nepali peacekeepers’ unique capacity to respect and empower community, earn their confidence and trust, and dedication to the fulfillment of the mandate have rendered them as one of the most sought after UN peacekeepers.
Our long experience in UN peace keeping tells us that the UN Security Council must be guided by the unity of purpose explicitly articulated in the mission’s mandate. Peace operations must be member- states driven process where UN General Assembly should have a better role, than it has today, in deciding the nature and mandate of the operations. Three key pillars of peace keeping operations i.e.- stabilizing the security situation, supporting national political process and ensuring economic revitalization- should always be holistically taken at the centre of the mandate. Our experience says that the ultimate aim of peacekeeping or peace building should be the socio-economic transformation of the conflict-affected countries.
To make such operations successful and capable of delivering on the mandate, we have called for substantive, institutionalized and structured consultation with troops and police contributing countries at all stages of UN peacekeeping. We attach high importance on the protection of civilians especially children and women, and have a policy of zero tolerance on sexual exploitation and abuses.
In line with this policy, last year Nepal joined the UN Secretary General’s compact on Sexual Exploitation and Abuses. We attach high importance on respect for the personal safety and security as well as dignity and honor of the peace keepers. As the demand for more robust engagement at the ground has increased in modern day peace operations, legal protection for the peacekeepers in the event of collateral damage remains equally important.
We consider that timely revision of the incentive structure should be a permanent feature to keep high morale of the officials serving in difficult circumstances. A fair share of representation in the leadership role, both at the UN headquarters and field missions, proportionate to contribution of the countries concerned is critically important.
There have been many happy anecdotes and examples of utmost bravery, dedication, discipline and sense of duty displayed by our peacekeepers even in extremely challenging environment and life threatening situations. They have received accolades for outstanding services and for the protection of people. Our happiest moments have been many, including when, as a recognition of the Nepalese peacekeepers’ contribution to the UNIFIL, a Nepalese soldier was included in the entourage of the then UN Secretary General to receive the Nobel Peace Prize awarded to the UN in 2001.
As part of our continuous engagement with the UN in the maintenance of international peace and security, recently we had the pleasure to host Under Secretary General for Peace Keeping Operations, Mr. Jean-Pierre Lacroix, and last year we had hosted Under Secretary General for Field Support. Both of these visits have provided good opportunities to enhance further cooperation in the areas of peacekeeping.
Nepal had its own share of the internal conflict followed by a home grown and successful peace process. United Nations supported us during the initial phase of our peace process through a focused and limited-mandate political mission for monitoring of the arms and combatants. We appreciate the UN for this support. As the political transition has ended and a new era of political stability has emerged in Nepal, our experience of the peace process may be useful to the countries in transition and those gone through conflict. We would be happy to share those experiences as a uniquely successful and home-grown brand of the peace process and contribute to the peace building elsewhere.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
With regard to the third pillar of the United Nations, I reiterate that Nepal’s commitment to the protection and promotion of human rights is total and unflinching. Despite the relatively smaller size of our economy, level of development and capacity, we have been party to 24 international human rights related instruments, and 7 out of 9 core instruments. True to our commitment, we have regularly submitted our periodic reports to the treaty bodies and faithfully implemented the outcomes after the consideration of the reports. This year alone three of our periodic reports are being considered by different human rights treaty bodies.
Our engagement with the UN human rights mechanism, including the human rights council and its special procedures mechanism as well as the UPR process, has been constructive. This year alone we have invited three special procedure mandate holders for the country visit. This is substantial for a country of our capacity and resources.
As a member of the Human Rights Council, Nepal’s role in the Council has been constructive. We firmly stand by the UNGA resolution 60/251 and the principle that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interrelated and mutually reinforcing. We recognize and adhere to the objectivity, non-selectivity and elimination of politicization and double standards in dealing with human rights issues.
At the home front, two amendment Bills related to the transitional justice mechanisms are under the process of submission to the Parliament. With laws in place, and terms of the two Commissions been extended, this will allow the investigation of all allegations of serious violations of human rights and ensure justice and accountability. I reiterate that there will be no blanket amnesty to serious violations of human rights.
Dear Friends,
The world we live in has increasingly become complex and unpredictable. We share concerns on the seeping crisis in multilateralism. Nepal always stands for multilateralism and considers the United Nations as an indispensable organization. We regard the United Nations as the only legitimate forum to deliberate and resolve the international issues of common concern.
Under the UN initiative, Nepal Chaired and led the process of Istanbul Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries during the 4th UN Conference for LDCs held in Istanbul. The Conference adopted Istanbul Program of Action (IPOA) for the Decade 2011-2020. The IPOA charts out international community’s vision and strategy for sustainable development of LDCs with a strong focus on developing their productive capacities. In line with the goal of the IPOA, Nepal has been preparing for the next cycle of review for graduating from LDC status.
At present, Nepal contributes to the UN processes as the Chair of the Bureau of Committee on Conference; Vice-Chair of the Executive Board of the UNICEF; Vice-Chair of the 28th Meeting of State Parties to the UN Convention on Law of the Sea; Vice-Chair of the Disarmament Commission; member of the UN Human Rights Council; member of the Executive Board of the UN Women; member of the Commission on Science and Technology Development; and Deputy Member of the ILO Governing Board. A member from Nepali trade union is also serving in the ILO Governing Board and a Nepali has been serving at the CEDAW Committee as its member.
Through these roles we have been closely working with the UN and contributing to the multilateral process.
With these words, I conclude my remarks. I thank the United Nations Association of Nepal for the felicitations and good wishes extended to me.
I also thank the organizers for having me in this useful forum and providing the opportunity to share my thoughts on this important theme.
I thank you for your attention.

Remarks by Minister for Foreign Affairs Hon. Pradeep Kumar Gyawali at the Dinner hosted for the Diplomatic Community
Kathmandu, 09 July 2018
Honourable Ministers
Excellencies
Ladies and gentlemen.
Saraswati and I have the pleasure to welcome you all to this dinner hosted in your honour. I thank you for joining us this evening.
It has been close to five months since the present Government assumed the responsibility and over three and a half month since I assumed the foreign Ministry portfolio. We have had occasions to meet individually and in other different formats. This evening is dedicated collectively to you and in your honour.
As you are well aware, the Right Honourable Prime Minister has clearly outlined the direction, priorities and behaviour of Nepal’s foreign policy when he shared the Government’s vision for the coming five years with the diplomatic community in March.
‘Amity with all, and enmity with none’remains the soul of our foreign policy. Nepal’s adherence to the principles of the UN Charter, Panchasheel, and the norms of world peace confirms to this. Guided by this spirit, we attach high importance to our relations with all countries and organizations that you represent.
Our policy of engaging constructively with all of our friends and partners has been mutually beneficial. We continue to work closely with our neighbours, major powers, development partners, countries in our extended neighbourhood, labour receiving countries, United Nations and multilateral financial institutions.
I consider this an opportunity for me to express our gratitude to all of our friends and development partners for the close and collaborative partnership that we enjoy. You all have been dependable friends and partners in the high and low that Nepal endured in past two decades. We remain thankful to you all for your continued support and cooperation in Nepal’s development efforts.
Excellencies,
In these few months of the Government in office, we have endeavored to enhance mutual trust and promote cooperation with our neighboring countries in the areas of our national priority. We have also renewed our partnership and have been engaging with all friendly countries in different continents.
The recent successful exchange of visits by the Prime Ministers of Nepal and India has contributed to promote trust and goodwill between the two countries and further consolidate bilateral relations.
We have agreed to strengthen ongoing cooperation and expand partnership on the basis of the principles of equality, mutual trust, respect and benefit. We agreed to advance cooperation in the areas of agriculture, railway linkages and inland waterways, among others.
The Prime Minister had a successful visit to our northern neighbor, China. We have agreed to intensify implementation of MoU on cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative to enhance connectivity. The cooperation covers building of dry ports, roads, railways, aviation and communications within the framework of Trans-Himalaya Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network. We believe that this will open up a new era of cross-border cooperation and foster trade, commerce and investment.
In the meantime, we had the honour to host the Prime Minister of Pakistan on a bilateral visit. The visit, taken place after a gap of many years, was successful in cementing the bilateral ties between our two countries.
Serbian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs visited Nepal in early May.
During this period, we have had fruitful bilateral consultation meetings with Brazil, Denmark, EU, Israel, Russia and Switzerland. All of these engagements have been successful in further consolidating the friendly bilateral relations.
In the regional front, we are preparing for hosting the 4th Summit meeting of the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sector Economic and Technical Cooperation (BIMSTEC) towards the end of August this year. Different meetings of the technical committees under the SAARC have been held.
Nepal participated in the Ministerial Meeting of the non-aligned movement held in Baku, Azerbaizan and Ministerial Meeting of International Think Tank for LLDCs held in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia at the Foreign Minister’s level.
In the same period, three Under-Secretaries General of the United Nations visited Nepal.
Excellencies,
As you all know, the motto of the present government is ‘Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali’. We know that there are challenges ahead, and realization of this goal is not possible with our efforts alone. In recognition of these challenges as well as the distance we have to travel on our way to prosperity, we expect to be engaged in an enhanced level of economic partnership in trade, investment, technology transfer, and tourism beyond development cooperation.
Maintaining stability, advancing socio-economic transformation, ensuring social justice, good governance and rule of law have been the overarching objectives of the present government. Promoting and adhering to the values and norms of integrity, transparency, and accountability are equally important priorities of the Government. They are applicable to both governmental and non-governmental stakeholders. With regard to the concern related to the draft integrity policy, I may clarify that the Government has no intention of curbing or discouraging the participation of stakeholders, including the civil society organizations, in our development efforts. They have been important partners in development and will continue to remain so.
While we encourage civil society organizations in our development activities, we are also aware of the ‘gaps’ that we need to address. We expect our civil society partners to avoid duplication, contribute in areas that help create jobs and bring tangible benefits to the people, and avoid scattering of scarce resources. Our sole objective isto addressthose gapsso that developmental benefits reach to the people. This has also been the voice of the civil society themselves for long that they function in a transparent and accountable manner. It is but natural for the government to expectthat the civil society partners align their activities with the policy and priorities of the Government so that synergetic effects could be generated in our development efforts.
Our commitment to democracy and the universal values of human rights and fundamental freedoms is total and unwavering.We have reached to this stage with decades of struggle and sacrifices of Nepali peoplefor the cause of democracy and freedom. This Government can never compromise on those achievements and values that we fought for. Respect for diversity and pluralism constitute the very spirit of Nepali society and this Government stands on that foundation. Therefore our commitment to pluralism is absolute.
This year alone will see Nepal’s three different periodic reportsbeing considered by three different human rights treaty bodies.
In March, we hosted Special Rapporteur on the Human Rights of Migrants, and we are preparing for the visit of special rapporteur on the violence against women, and special rapporteur on right to food this year.
Two amendment Bills related to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons are currently under consideration of the Parliament. With the new law in place and terms of the Commissions been extended, this will allow the investigation of all allegations of serious violations of human rights and humanitarian laws and ensure justice and accountability. There will be no blanket amnesty to serious violations of human rights.
Excellencies, 
We live in a complex and unpredictable world. We share the concerns about the simmeringuncertainties in multilateralism. However, Nepal’s faith in multilateralism remains unshaken. We consider the United Nations as anindispensable organization in multilateral affairs and supportits reform for further strengthening. United Nations is the only legitimate forum to deliberate and resolve the international issues of common concern.
We are encouraged by the adoption of the resolution on repositioning of UN development system by the UNGA recently. This is intended for robust implementation of SDGs. We look forward to the impending repositioning that is aimed at addressing the gaps, building synergy and improving accountability, steering clear from the politicization of development.
Nepal will continue its contribution to the UN Peacekeeping Operations. Our own experience of the peace process may be useful to the countries in transition and those gone through conflict. We would be happy to share our experience as a uniquely successful and home-grown brand of the peace process and contribute to the peace building elsewhere.
We welcome the 2018 Inter-Korea Summit between the leaders of the South and North Korea and resulting thaw on the Korean peninsula. We also welcome the rapprochement between the United States and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and hope this will result into denuclearization and a lasting peace in the region.
Excellencies,
The pace of reconstruction has moved on satisfactorily. We are close to the final phase of the reconstruction and rebuilding of the individual houses, which we anticipate to be completed in a year. Reconstruction and restoration works of the heritage sites and the public buildings are too moving smoothly that will take some more time to complete. We are grateful to all our friends and partners for their cooperation and generous assistance in this process.
Since the political transition is over and a new era of political stability has emerged in Nepal, our priorities and modalities for engagement demand commensurate adjustments. We are in an early phase of federalization. It is incumbent upon us to make this process successful. The Constitution allocatesthe matters related to foreign relations under the competence of the federal government.It is in this context that we had to devise code of conduct and advise our partners from the diplomatic community to follow the official channel of communications on the mattersofdevelopment partnership. The Ministry of Foreign Affairsremains available to facilitate you in that process.
With these words, I once again welcome you all to this dinner. Allow me to purpose a toast for the continued friendship and cooperation between Nepal and the friendly countries and institutions that you all represent.
I thank you all for your attention.

Reply Speech by The Rt. Hon. K P Sharma Oli, Prime Minister of Nepal at the Dinner hosted in his honour by H. E. Mr. Qi Zhala, Chairman of the People’s Government of Tibet Autonomous Region of China
(22 June 2018, Lhasa)
                                                            
His Excellency Mr. Qi Zhala, Chairman of the People’s Government
of Tibet Autonomous Region of the People’s Republic of China
Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Good Evening!
It gives me great pleasure to be amidst so many important friends of Nepal. My wife Radhika joins me in expressing our sincere thanks and gratitude to you, Mr. Chairman, and the Government of the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) for hosting this lovely dinner and for the warm welcome.
We arrived in Lhasa this afternoon after completing our three-day visit to Beijing. I had fruitful meetings with President Xi Jinping, Premier Li Keqiang and Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress Li Zhanshu. On all occasions, we exchanged views on the ways and means of further widening and deepening our traditionally warm friendship.
I have visited Lhasa before on several occasions, and most recently in July 2017. Every time I visit this historic and beautiful city, I feel homely and find myself deeply attached. I am fascinated by its freshness and purity in nature and culture, and inspired by its incredible development speed.
Lhasa is an epitome of unbelievable balance between rich cultural heritage and modernity. It reflects a perfect balance between ancient civilization and modernity. Development in TAR has been possible due to visionary leadership and proper guidance of the People’s Government of the Tibet Autonomous Region as well as the dedication and diligence of the Tibetan People.
Relations between Nepal and the Tibet Autonomous Region of China can be traced back to centuries. The marriage of a Nepali princess Bhrikuti to the Tibetan King Tsong Tsan Gampo in the 7th century is a testimony to our age-old and time-tested cordial relations.
Nepali artisan Araniko first built a temple in Tibet before traveling to Beijing where he built the world famous White Pagoda, which stands today as one of the enduring symbols of Nepal-China friendship and cooperation.
Nepal and China established formal relations in 1955. Our relations have always been friendly and cooperative. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence provide a solid basis for our relationship. We enjoy a trouble-free relationship.
We are firmly committed to the One-China policy. We have consistently maintained Tibet and Taiwan as integral parts of the People’s Republic of China. We are also committed to not allowing our territory to be used against the core interests of China.
In the last three decades, Tibet Autonomous Region has registered incredible success in its economic and infrastructural development. As a close neighbor and true friend, Nepal cherishes and takes pride in the rapid development of TAR.
My Government has the motto of ‘Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali’. Development experience, expertise and technology of Tibet Autonomous Region will be of help to realize our development goals.
We are thankful to the continued cooperation extended by the People’s Government of the Tibet Autonomous Region. Nepal and TAR are linked by geography, culture, religion and traditions. Similarity of culture and lifestyle prevailing in the northern part of Nepal and the Tibet Autonomous Region has brought our people even closer.
Today, Tibet Autonomous Region serves as a gateway for Nepal to mainland China. Relationship between Nepal and Tibet serve as the basis for historical, social, cultural and geographical roots of our bilateral ties.
Regular exchanges of visits, ideas and views at various levels and occasions have further contributed to strengthening our relations.
Our ties are very strong and multidimensional. We need to build on this asset and advance mutually beneficial cooperation in various fields. Our two countries have tremendous opportunities of enhancing bilateral cooperation in the areas of trade, tourism, investment and connectivity, among others.
I am happy to note that Nepal and China will work towards strengthening connectivity within the framework of trans-Himalayan Multi-dimensional Connectivity Network. This has been the central outcome of my visit to China this time. Railway, road, aviation, transmission ways, ports and communication are its key aspects. Since this will involve TAR, it will also have an important role to play in advancing the overall development of connectivity on the Chinese side.
We need cooperation of the Government of TAR in supporting the livelihood of our people living in the northern regions of Nepal by enhancing cross border connectivity with more border points.
We would like to work with China for deepening economic partnership for mutual benefit. Taking this opportunity, I would like to invite the Chinese investment in the construction of cross-border economic zones, SEZs and industrial park. My Government is committed to create conducive investment climate in Nepal for Chinese investors.
With these words, let me express sincere appreciation, on behalf of my wife, and other members in my delegation as well as and on my own, to you, Mr. Chairman, for hosting this lovely dinner.
Finally,

I wish for the good health and happiness of President Xi Jinping, Premier Li Keqiang and other State leaders and all the provincial leaders of TAR!
I wish for the everlasting friendship between Nepal and China!
I wish for closer cooperation between Nepal and TAR!
I wish for further progress and prosperity of TAR!

Thank you!

Rt. Hon’ble Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli addressed the Nepal-China Business Forum today in Beijing
Posted onJune 20, 2018June 20, 2018 

Addressed by The Right Hon’able K. P. Sharma Oli, Prime Minister of Nepal, to the Nepal-China Business Forum (Beijing, June 20, 2018)
 
Chairman of the CCPIT,
The Ambassador, 
Distinguished members of the business community 
Friends from Media,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
 
It is a distinct pleasure for me to be amongst the prominent business leaders from China and Nepal.
It is always a pleasure to come to a close friendly country on a visit. This is my second visit to China as the Prime Minister of Nepal. I visited China earlier in March 2016 during my first tenure.
I thank you for warmly welcoming me and my delegation here today.
At the outset, I would like to thank the Embassy of Nepal and China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT) for organizing this important event.
We commend the CCPIT for its efforts in promoting Nepal-China economic relations.
 
Dear friends! 
One would feel really proud of talking about Nepal-China relations. Nepal and China are close neighbours linked by geography, culture and traditions. Our relations date back to antiquity. Formal relations were established in 1955.
Our relations are multidimensional that encompass political, economic, social and cultural aspects.
Our political relations, which are based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence, have always remained cordial and friendly. We share a trouble-free and cooperative relationship. Over the years, our relations have grown both qualitatively and quantitatively. High level of mutual trust and confidence underpin our ties.
Nepal is firmly committed to One China policy. We have a principled position that we do not allow our soil to be used against China. This is translated into day-to-day reality.
Dear friends!
Our two countries have been in close and continuous engagement, be it in the fields of economy, trade and commerce, or in the field of culture or people-to-people relations.
Our two countries have a long history of trading relations that began with the engagement of merchants from either side of the Himalayas since early days, which set the foundation of our economic relations.
Our two countries are not only good friends but also reliable development partners.
Nepal is a land of vast opportunities for development. Yet, our rich resource base has largely remained dormant due to financial and technological gap. We want to change this scenario and create success stories. We believe that China, with its huge financial and technological capability, can help us to transform our development landscape.
Many people believe that the success story of the 21st century will be written as the success story of China. Our great friend, China, has astonished the world by attaining unprecedented progress in many spheres. We share the joy of tremendous achievements of China, our close neighbour and true friend.  We also cherish China’s positive and influential role in global arena.
Dear friends!
We note with pleasure that you have made China:
-The second largest economy in the world
– The largest industrial producer
– The largest holder of foreign currencies reserves
-The largest exporter of merchandise goods in the world
– The second largest FDI provider,
-A global leader in development finance, and
– A key driver of global growth and prosperity.
We are happy to see such unprecedented strides China has made in socio-economic and technological developments. Being a close and next-door neighbour of China, it is quite natural for Nepal to aspire for partnership with China for mutual benefits.
We can create a symbiotic relationship in business sector between our two countries, which would be a situation of win-win collaboration.
 
Dear friends!
While we greatly admire success story of China, I do have something to share with you about momentous change that Nepal has undergone in its political history. Having witnessed a long period of conflict and instability, Nepal was successful in promulgating a highly progressive and democratic constitution in 2015.
The constitution has institutionalized political gains that we have achieved during the struggle of over 7 decades, and made people of Nepal truly sovereign.
After the successful holding of elections at three tiers of federal setup, governments at all levels have been formed with strong majority. At the centre, the Government enjoys more than two-third majority. Passing through a long political transition, we have now entered an era of political stability; an era of peace and prosperity.
The unification of two leftist parties, namely CPN (UML) and CPN (Maoist Centre), will provide much needed political stability in the country. Building on political stability, we have undertaken a decisive journey towards development and prosperity. Our motto is ‘Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali’.
Political stability ensures policy stability, coherency and continuity. Stability in policy regime is a prerequisite for foreign investment. Now my government assures you that there will be policy stability and continuity.  My government has a clear vision, straight- forward action plan and strategy, firm commitment, overwhelming mass support and ability to implement the development perspectives.
My government is committed to translating people’s aspiration for peace, stability and prosperity into reality.
Economic prosperity should not and cannot be a long-deferred dream for Nepali people.
We aspire to become a middle-income country by 2030 and graduate from LDC status at an early date.
To reach these destinations, we require massive investment in infrastructure development and induction of advanced and innovative technology.
We confidently count on Chinese investment in filling our financial as well as technological gap. And, I believe our friend China is willing to do this.
Investing in Nepal, now, is really a profitable business. The government is determined to maintain an investment friendly environment, not by word but by action.
With the end of political transition and strong government in place, situation of law and order in the country has been improved remarkably. So is the situation in terms of industrial relations.
Nepal is a virgin land for investment. A land of immense potentials for investment in the areas of hydropower, agriculture, tourism, services, manufacturing industries, among others.
It gives me a great pleasure to share that China remains the largest source of FDI in Nepal. It is our second largest trading partner. Economic engagement between our two countries has been growing rapidly.
Our focus on trans- Himalayan connectivity will create a conducive environment for bilateral trade and facilitate increased movement of goods and services.
 
Dear friends!
Investors always look for market, which is not a problem in Nepal.
As you all know, Nepal is located between two vibrant markets of the world, India and China with a population of over 2.5 billion. Production is the only problem.  Our productive capacity is limited.
We enjoy Duty Free Quota Free (DFQF) access into Chinese market to more than 8000 Nepali products. We have been requesting the Chinese government to grant enhanced level of market access to 512 tradable products. We also enjoy duty free access to European market and preferential market access to the USA for over 70 products as an LDC.
I am here to listen to you and know your views.
We are committed to further improving business climate in the country. We are ready to do everything that enhances your confidence, that facilitate your engagements and that helps you to make quick decision for investment.
We have enacted the laws and policies on foreign investment, Public-Private Partnership, industrial enterprises, banking and intellectual property.
Almost every sector including manufacturing, hydropower, IT, services, tourism, mining, and agro-based industries are open for foreign investment. Our negative list is very small.
 
Let me highlight some potentials in Nepal.
Nepal- an attractive land for diversified agriculture- with vast geographical and bio diversity-comprising the arable land just 80 meter above the sea level to the top of the world.  This provides an opportunity for all kinds of agro products.
Nepal- a lucrative land for investment in hydro sector with more than 1,00,000 MW capacity, but remains untapped so far.
Nepal- a reservoir of mines and minerals such as iron, cement and precious stones, yet to be explored.
Nepal- an attractive tourist destination with world renowned heritage sites, most favoured trekking routes, fascinating wild lives and amazing scenic beauty, with hospitable and welcoming people.
And many more.
We are also committed to maintain liberal economic policy with private sector as a key partner. We have no intention to reverse the trends. We want to assure you that we cannot go against the global trends.
Nepal Investment Board currently headed by the Prime Minister will be further strengthened by amending Investment Board Act.
It will be developed as an institution to permit investment through one-door system promoting public private partnership.
 
Dear friends!
There is a favourable fiscal environment in Nepal.
We have low tax slabs, no income tax on earnings of industry exporting its products established in Special Economic Zones for certain period of time, exemption of tax and tax holidays for certain industries, exemption of duty and fees on the key inputs used by an export Industry.
Our law permits full repatriation of income earned from investment and reinvestment.
Foreign companies registered in Nepal can purchase, own and sell land.
No discrimination is made between national and foreign investors. There is no policy of nationalization of private industry.
The other factor that makes you competitive in Nepal is availability of cheaper labour force and improved labour law and industrial relations.
Infrastructure is key to economic development. Both of our Governments are working on the establishment of Cross Border Economic Zones near Nepal-China border and further develop the existing border points between the two countries.
Our two countries have been formally linked by optical fibre since the beginning of this year.
We are planning for cross-border connectivity of railways, transmission lines and establishment of new international airports. Partnership with Chinese investors to complete these priority projects will be very important.
Our both countries have signed some MoUs and agreements like Framework Agreement on Promotion of Investment and Economic Cooperation, MoU on Energy Cooperation and MoU on Investment and Cooperation on Production Capacity which will facilitate and reinforce the collaboration between the investors of the two countries.
Nepal has joined the BRI, a visionary initiative launched by President Xi Jinping. We believe that this initiative offers immense opportunities for collaboration and partnership between our two countries. Growing attraction of the international community towards BRI has made it one of the biggest platform for international cooperation.
China is an important source of international tourism market. The flow of Chinese tourist to Nepal has been quite significant in recent time. I am happy to see the increasing trend of Chinese tourists in Nepal.
As we are gifted by beautiful bounty of nature as well as culture, the Himalayas as well as heritages, wildlife as well as spiritual sites, tourism sector bears a potential to be a key mover of our economy.
The Government is very much committed to the safety and security of the tourists. Special provisions are being made for the security and emergency rescue of the mountaineers and trekkers.
The government has announced to observe 2020 as “Visit Nepal Year” with the goal of welcoming two million tourists each year.
I would like to encourage the Chinese tourists as well as travel/tour agencies to make the best use of Nepal’s visa fee waiver facility.
I would also like to encourage the Chinese investors to invest in tourism infrastructure of Nepal.
 
Dear friends,
We are happy to note that private sectors of our two countries have developed good relations and collaborated on a number of investment proposals. Your gathering here today will give you yet another opportunity to forge partnership for meaningful business initiatives in Nepal.
My Government is committed to extending all support to facilitate your business venture in Nepal. Let’s match excellent political relationship with an equally sound economic and business partnership. Let’s work towards creating a win-win scenario for both of our countries and people.
And I assure you, Chinese friends, that your venture in Nepal will be profitable and secure. You will gain, not loose.
With these words, let me once again thank the organizers for this programme.
Thank you.

尼泊尔总理卡普·夏尔马·奥利阁下 在尼泊尔驻中国大使为他举行的招待会上的致辞
北京希尔顿逸林酒店，2018年6月19日
Dear Friends:
नमस्कार।निहाओ।
I would like thank you all for the warm welcome you have extended to me and mydelegation in China today.
वहन्गाओसिङ्जिआन्दाओनिमन्दाजिआ।
तपाईँहरुसबैसँगभेट्नपाउँदामअत्यन्तप्रसन्नछु।
亲爱的朋友们：
感谢你们对我和代表团在中国的热烈欢迎。
 
I have always felt at home in China.
In particular, I have very fond memories of my visit to the People’s Republic of China in March 2016 as Prime Minister of Nepal。
在中国，我一直感觉很自在。特别是2016年3月，我以尼泊尔总理身份访问中华人民共和国的时候，留下了非常美好的回忆。
During that visit, we, the leaders of Nepal and China, agreed to elevate our bilateral relations to a higher pedestal.
在上次访问中，两国领导人一致同意将尼中关系提升到一个更高水平。
We signed important agreements on the areas of transit transport, connectivity, trade and investment, and co-operation.
We agreed to be partners-in-development under the Belt and Road Initiative.
We agreed to accelerate economic development in our respective countries, promote bilateral trade and investments, establish cross-border economic zones, and build cross-border railways and railways network in Nepal, and facilitate people-to-people exchanges.
我们就过境运输、互联互通、贸易投资和合作等领域签署了重要协议；同意在一带一路倡议下建立发展伙伴关系；加快各自国家的经济发展，促进双边贸易和投资；同意建立跨境经济区，建设跨境铁路和尼泊尔铁路网，促进人民之间的交流。
In short, we embarked on a new chapter of our bilateral relations; we ushered in a new era of peace and prosperity for our peoples; we laid the foundations for a bright future for all.
简单地说，我们开启了双边关系的新篇章，为尼中两国人民开创了一个和平与繁荣的新时代，也为各国人民的光明未来奠定了基础。
 
Dear Friends:
I have come again to China with the treasure of deep trust and understanding between our two countries and with a new vision for Nepal-China relations in the new era.
亲爱的朋友们：
我带着两国间深厚的信任和理解再次来到中国，并带来了新时期尼中关系新的展望。
Our relations are embedded in the history of civilizations between the land where Shakyamuni Buddha was born, and the birth place of Confucius.
我们两国的关系植根于佛陀诞生地与孔子诞生地之间的文明史上。
The teachings of tolerance, compassion, moderation and harmony are our common heritage.
Such universal values of peace, friendship and harmony continue to guide our bilateral relations, and it is on the foundations of our shared values that Nepal and China will continue to prosper and flourish together.
两位圣人关于“宽容、同情心与和谐”的教义是我们共同的财富。这种和平、友谊与和谐的普世价值观继续指引着我们的双边关系，尼泊尔和中国将在共同的价值观基础上继续共同繁荣。
Let me recall as an old Chinese proverb that says:
“If there is light in the soul, there will be beauty in the person
If there is beauty in the person, there will be harmony at home
If there is harmony at home, there will be order in the nation
If there is order in the nation, there will be peace in the world.”
正如一句古老的中国谚语所说：“修身、齐家、治国、平天下”
Shakyamuni Buddha’s teachings also have a similar essence of peace, and compassion for every human being as the foundations of a harmonious society.
That strife and discord should give way to co-operation and harmony for collective well-being is the essence of the teachings of our fore-fathers.
释迦牟尼佛祖也有类似的教义，和平以及对众生的慈悲是和谐社会的基础。
冲突和分歧应该让位给合作与和谐，以谋取集体福祉，这是我们祖先教诲的精髓。
Dear Friends: 
Informed by similar cultural norms and values, Nepal and China have always stood beside each other in the past, achieved successes and supported each other at times of difficulties.
亲爱的朋友们：在相似的文化规范和价值观的指引下，尼泊尔和中国过去始终站在一起，取得成功，并在困难时期相互支持。
Therefore, Nepal and China will continue to work together in the future for common development and everlasting peace and prosperityin a spirit of mutual trust, friendship and understanding, and close co-operation and collaboration.
因此，尼中两国今后将本着相互信任、友好谅解、密切合作的精神，继续为共同发展、持久和平与繁荣而共同努力。
In such co-operative exchanges, I see the following as being important pillarsof Nepal-China relations:
在这样的合作交流中，我认为以下领域是尼中关系的重要支柱：
Transport and Connectivity
交通与连接
The rapid and phenomenal advancement of transportation technology has brought profound changes in contemporary society. Transportation is the backbone of an economy, whether in developed or developingstatus, and is a vital public good today. In fact, economic growth and socio-economic transformation are not possible without an infrastructure base, particularly in transport and communications.
交通运输技术的迅猛发展，给当代社会带来了深刻的变化。无论是发达国家还是发展中国家，交通都是经济的支柱，也是当今社会的一项重要公益事业。事实上，没有足够的基础设施基础，特别是交通和通信设施，经济增长和社会经济转型是不可能实现的。
Against this backdrop, the present government has placed highpriority on developing transport networks within and across the border. I believerailway connectivity, in particular, is of vital importance to a landlocked country in order to reduce transaction and transport transit costs, diversify international trade and transit, and promote tourism and service sectors of the economy. Therefore, with a view to improve connectivity and trade, Nepal and China  agreed in principle to develop railway network, across the Himalayas,during my first visit to China in March  2016.We are committed to taking forward this important initiative further, and develop the cross-border railway infrastructure to mark a new era in Nepal-China friendship and bilateral co-operation.  In addition to railways,Nepal and China are also committed to developingmultidimensional connectivity networks of roadways, airways, communications, and energy.
在此背景下，本届尼泊尔政府高度重视发展边境内外交通网络。我认为，道路连接，尤其是铁路连接对于一个内陆国家来说至关重要，可以降低交易和运输过境成本，使国际贸易多样化，促进旅游业和服务业的发展。因此，为了提高道路连接和贸易，在我2016年3月第一次访问中国期间，尼泊尔和中国已经原则上同意发展跨越喜马拉雅山的铁路网。我们将致力于进一步推进这一重要倡议，发展跨界铁路基础设施，开启尼中友谊和双边合作的新时代，开发多元化道路、航空、通信和能源连接网络。
I strongly believe that such connectivity willinject enormous vitality in the regional economy by connecting Nepal’s economy with that of China, the world’s second largest economy. There is no doubt that efficient connectivity networks will put Nepal in the global value chain of production and distribution.
In addition, the north-south road corridors cross border transmission lines, and greater connectivity by air and telecommunications will bring enormous economic benefits to our peoples.
Indeed, greater connectivity between Nepal and China will transform and enhance the respective productive capacities of our economies, and create new opportunities for our peoples.
我坚信，通过尼泊尔与世界第二大经济体中国的经济连接，必将为区域经济注入巨大的活力。毫无疑问，高效率的连通网络将使尼泊尔进入全球生产和分销链，此外，南北公路走廊、跨境传输线以及航空和电信的连通，将给两国人民带来巨大的经济利益。加强尼泊尔与中国之间的连通将改变和提高两国经济的生产力，并为两国人民创造新的机会。
Tourism and Culture
旅游和文化
Nepal lies at the confluence of not only physical topographies but also of ancient cultures and civilizations, creating a veritable paradise on earth. While Nepal is one of the world’s most fascinating destinations in terms of Cultural diversity, Natural beauty and Adventure Tourism, China has emerged as the source of the largest number of outbound tourists worldwide. By developing efficient connectivity networks, Nepal can benefit even more from the tourism industry while China can benefit from investment opportunities in the relatively unexplored hospitality industry of Nepal.
尼泊尔不仅在地理上是多种地形的交汇处，同时在文化上也融合了各种不同的古代文明，是名副其实的旅游天堂。尼泊尔在文化多样性、自然美景和冒险旅游方面是世界上最吸引人的旅游目的地之一，同时中国已成为世界上出境游客最多的国家之一。通过发展高效的连通网络，尼泊尔可以从旅游业中受益更多，而中国也可以从尼泊尔尚未开发的旅游服务业中获得投资机会。
Trade and Investment
贸易和投资
As important parts of the ancient Silk Road, both Nepal and China have benefited greatly from vibrant trade and commerce in the past. Nepal was a vibrant trade corridor for ancient China into South Asia. Both the countries should rejuvenate the Southern Silk Road and further boost their economies for mutual benefit. We should revive such robust economic exchanges between us, and create opportunities for our peoples.
尼泊尔和中国都是古代丝绸之路的重要组成部分，过去两国都从繁荣的商贸往来中获益良多。尼泊尔是古代中国通往南亚的充满活力的贸易走廊。我们要振兴南丝绸之路，进一步促进经济互利，复兴两国间蓬勃的经济交往，为两国人民创造更多机会。
Agriculture, Industries and Technology Transfer
农业、工业和技术转让
Agriculture and industrial development through technology transfer are important areas for Nepal-China co-operation, which will create employment for the young people and rejuvenate rural livelihoods.
通过能力建设和技术转让发展农业和工业，是尼中合作的重要领域，将为青年创造就业机会，振兴农村生计。
Unlocking Human Potentials
开发人才潜力
The resourcefulness, creativity and resilience of the Nepali people have received worldwide recognition and acclaim.
Similarly, the hard work, innovativeness and precision of Chinese people are well-known.
We need to unlock the full potentials of such exceptional manpower through adequate investments in health and education and skills development.
Nepal and China should work together to tap this reservoir of talents through mutual partnership and co-operation.
尼泊尔人民的机智、创造力和韧性得到全世界的认可和赞扬。同样，中国人民的勤奋、创新和精准也是众所周知的。我们必须充分挖掘这些优秀人力的潜能，在卫生、教育和技能发展方面进行充分的投资。尼泊尔和中国应该通过互惠合作伙伴关系，共同开发这一人才资源。
Natural Resources and Environment
自然资源和环境
Nepal possesses vast water resources as well as herbs, cool climatic zones, and natural diversity which can be harnessed together for common benefits. Developing clean energy for our own use and possible exchange of the surplus power is one of the most potential sectors for Nepal-China co-operation. I would like to call upon Chinese enterprises to take advantage of these vast investment openings by deploying their state-of-the-art technologies in power development for mutual benefits.
尼泊尔拥有丰富的水资源、草药、凉爽的气候和自然多样性，可以共同利用。目前尼中合作最有潜力的方向之一，就是发展清洁能源供国内使用以及出口剩余电力。我呼吁中国企业充分利用这些巨大的投资机会，使用最先进的技术在电力开发中实现互利共赢。
Co-operation and collaboration between Nepal and China on the above areas will create enormous opportunities for the two countries, and also institute a firm foundation for prosperity and well-being of our peoples for now and also for posterity.
尼中两国在上述领域的合作将创造巨大的机遇，为两国人民和子孙后代的繁荣和福祉奠定坚实的基础。
Dear Friends:
Leaving behind uncertainty and long drawn-out political transition, we have now arrived at a critical juncture in Nepal’s political and economic history.
It is no ordinary feat that we have peacefully and successfully accomplished the task of electing representatives to three tiers of government, and put in place a system of grassroots democracy.
亲爱的朋友们：
尼泊尔告别了漫长的政治转型和不确定性，迈入了尼泊尔政治和经济史上的一个关键时期。我们成功地完成了选举三级政府代表的任务，并建立了基层民主制度，这是一个伟大的壮举。
With these landmark achievements, Nepal has embarked on a new voyage of political stability and socio-economic transformation.
有了这些里程碑式的成就，尼泊尔开始了政治稳定和社会经济转型的新航程。
My dream of a ‘Sambriddha Nepal, Sukhi Nepali’ (Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali) is not just a dream but a mandate received from the people of Nepal, and we have no choice but to achieve it, within a stipulated time-frame.
我呼吁的“繁荣的尼泊尔，快乐的尼泊尔人”的梦想，不仅是一个梦想，也是尼泊尔人民的委托，我们别无选择，一定要在规定的期限内实现这一目标。
To achieve this objective, I would like to call upon all, including our Chinese friends such as businessmen and entrepreneurs present here this evening, to join hands together in our journey of common development and shared prosperity.
Let me emphasize that you are all most welcome in Nepal.
You are welcome to invest and do business in Nepal.
We welcome you as most trusted and valuable partners in Nepal’s economic development.
为了实现这一目标，我呼吁所有国家，包括今晚在座的商人和企业家等中国朋友，携起手来，共同发展，共同繁荣。我想再次强调，我们非常欢迎大家到尼泊尔投资做生意，欢迎你们成为尼泊尔经济发展中最值得信赖和最宝贵的伙伴。
Before I conclude, may I reiterate my full commitment and determination towards elevating Nepal-China ties to newer heights, and deepening them further in all aspects of our multi-dimensional relations for the benefit of our two peoples.
I thank you for your kind attention.
Thank you!
最后，请允许我重申，我将致力于提升尼中关系到新的高度，进一步深化两国多领域关系的各个方面，造福两国人民。感谢您的关注。谢谢！

Statement by Hon. Pradeep Kumar Gyawali, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Nepal at the inaugural Ministerial Conference of the International Think Tank for the Landlocked Developing Countries Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia
Posted onJune 12, 2018June 12, 2018 

 (11-12 June 2018)
Mr. Chairman,
Honourable Ministers, 
Excellencies, 
Distinguished delegates,
Ladies and gentlemen.
First of all, I congratulate you all on the happy occasion of the inaugural conference of the International Think Tank for the Landlocked Developing Countries (ITT-LLDCs), which we are concluding today, and express my best wishes for the success of the Think Tank.
I would like to thank and appreciate the Government of Mongolia for hosting this inaugural conference of the Think Tank and for the warm hospitality and excellent arrangements made for the Conference.
I commend Mongolia for the leadership and important role it has played over the years towards establishing the Think Tank. I also recognize the role played by all Member States of the Think Tank that helped to bring this important achievement in the form of international think tank for Land-locked developing countries.
I also take this opportunity to thank all the members of the Governing Board for their substantive work during their session last month. I believe this conference s been able to guide the process of the ITT-LLDC in a more firm footing.
Nepal attaches great importance to this organization. This has created an enormous hope among the land-locked developing countries. In fact, we are happy that Nepal’s accession, as the 10th member, triggered the entry into force of the Multilateral Agreement for the Establishment of the Think Tank in October 2017.
The establishment of the Think Tank is a milestone achievement for the LLDCs. We believe that the organization like ITT should have been established long ago but it is never late to start a good thing. ITT represents this good beginning for our collective good. We believe that the Think Tank can and should play a critical role in promoting the interests of LLDCs.
 
Mr. Chairman,
LLDCs have special development needs and challenges arising from their landlockedness, remoteness and geographical constraints. Addressing these challenges is key to their inclusive growth, which in turn will contribute to raising human development and reducing poverty in these countries.  This is also the overarching goal of the Vienna Programme of Action (VPOA) with a focus on all six priority areas.
Nepal considers that the VPOA should be mainstreamed in our national development policies and plans as well as that of transit countries. The work programmes of United Nations and other international organizations designed to support the LLDCs should also be aligned with the objectives and goals of the VPOA in a coherent manner.
We should also be able to harness full potentials of science, technology and innovations, including the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and space technologies to overcome the constraints to the development of LLDCs. Technological innovations do have potentials to reduce the burden of landlockedness and open up the vistas of opportunities. We heard a good deal of insights in this regards yesterday.
As we are preparing for the Mid-Term Review of the implementation of VPOA in 2019, we acknowledge that the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development should be in tandem with the VPOA for the much-needed synergy to achieve results on the ground.
As the first ever intergovernmental body of the LLDC group, the Think Tank has an important responsibility. It should be fully operationalized so that it can contribute, through top-quality research and advocacy, towards improving the ability of landlocked developing countries to build capacity for benefiting from the international trade. Focus in this regard should be to carry out in-depth research on converting “landlockedness” into “landlinkedness” and on various ways and options the LLDCs can diversify their economies. It is also important that ITT should focus on attracting more FDI by conducting more research on building capacities, raising confidence of investors through minimizing risks and creating more conducive domestic environment. Similarly, ITT also needs to focus its studies and research on smoothening transit facilities and associated issues.
ITT’s role in equipping and preparing our representatives and diplomats in international trade negotiations can be crucial. In this regard, we thank the ITT for bringing out the useful Handbook for Practitioners. Backed with quality inputs and support, LLDCs will be in better position to contribute to and benefit from such processes.
Mr. Chairman,
It is important to ensure adequate resources required for effective operationalization of the Think Tank. In this regard, Nepal is ready to contribute what it can, and for now pledges to make a modest one-time contribution of USD 30,000 for the Think Tank.
Support from all sides will be important. We need to expand our outreach to encourage all fellow LLDCs to join the Think Tank. I also call upon all the developed land-locked countries as well as transit countries, development partners and international organizations to continue their solidarity for LLDCs and support the Think Tank.
I conclude, Mr. Chairman, by highlighting one fact that the success of the Think Tank is also the success of LLDCs. So, we should join our hands for developing the Think Tank into a credible, respected and useful international organization.
I thank you for your attention.

Remarks by The Rt. Hon’ble K. P. Sharma Oli, Prime Minister of Nepal, at the joint media briefing
Posted onMay 11, 2018May 20, 2018 


Press Notes
Remarks by The Rt. Hon’ble K. P. Sharma Oli, Prime Minister of Nepal, at the joint media briefing with His Excellency Shri Narendra Modi, Prime Minister of India, Kathmandu, 11 May 2018
Your Excellency Prime Minister Modiji,
 Hon’ble Ministers,
 Excellencies,
 Distinguished media persons,
A very warm welcome to you, dear Prime Minister Modiji, on your State Visit to Nepal. Thank you for accepting our invitation. We are pleased to welcome the Prime Minister from a close, friendly neighbor.
The people of Nepal join me in extending warm greetings to you. This is your third visit to Nepal. We have fond memories of your previous two visits.
Extensive and deep-rooted Nepal-India relations deserve regular exchange of visits at higher levels. We will continue this tradition in the interest of our two countries and peoples in the future.
We have met here in Kathmandu in about a month’s time since we met in New Delhi. I fondly recall our meeting last month and extensive discussions and exchange of views that we had on various aspects of Nepal-India relations in an open and frank manner.
Prime Minister Modiji and I have just concluded bilateral discussions on the entire gamut of our relationship in an atmosphere of warmth and cordiality that characterizes the deep friendship and understanding between our two countries.
We reiterated our firm commitment to take our relations forward on the basis of equality, mutual trust, respect and benefit. Relations between neighbours are different from that of others. Neihbourhood constitutes top priority in our foreign policy.
I conveyed to Prime Minister Modiji our strong desire to see our relations mirroring the 21st century realities. I believe that the EPG-NIR’s recommendations would be important for updating our relations commensurate with the changed context.
Our desire is to create a strong edifice of relationship underpinned by mutual trust so that it is not shaken by any occasional or intermittent differences that are natural between neighbours.
Our two countries are interdependent in many ways. Hence, peace, stability and prosperity in one contribute to the achievement and maintenance of the same in the other.
Building on the outcome of our last meeting in New Delhi, we agreed to take effective measures for the implementation of all agreements and understandings reached in the past. We also agreed to take concrete measures to realize the benefits of new partnership for agriculture and connectivity by rail links and inland waterways. We have agreed to address all matters by September 19 on our Constitution Day or the National Day. To this effect, two foreign secretaries will work.
We agreed that the Agriculture Ministers of our two countries will meet soon to concretize priority areas and develop a work plan for implementation including in agricultural research and development, education, training and scholarship, and collaboration between our relevant institutions. We will expeditiously work for launching pilot projects on organic farming and soil health monitoring.
We both underlined that an early finalization of the DPR of the Pancheshwar Multipurpose Project is essential to gain mutual benefits in the areas of energy, irrigation and flood control. The team of Experts/Officials will meet soon for this purpose.
Just a while ago, Modiji and I jointly laid the foundation stone of 900 MW Arun-III hydropower project here. We hope that the operationalization of the project would help enhance cooperation in the generation and trade of power between the two countries. In this context our attention needs to be focused on the full implementation of the Power Trade Agreement (PTA) signed between the two countries. I appreciate India’s initiatives to revise the Guidelines/Regulations on Cross Border Trade of Electricity in consultation with stakeholders.
Our two sides will continue to engage in studying the matters concerning the Energy Banking mode of electricity transaction. Our agencies will expeditiously study and suggest modalities for the New Butwal – Gorakhpur (New) 400 kV Transmission Line and Nepali portion of which would be implemented by the Government of Nepal from its own resources.
Each year a large part of Nepal’s Terai region faces the problem of inundation. In view of the impending monsoon season and considering the past agreement between our two sides, both our sides will immediately send a joint team to the inundation prone areas to take appropriate measures to address this problem.
Trade and transit are vital components of Nepal-India bilateral relations and both of us underscored their importance. India is our largest trading partner. However, the growing trade deficit of Nepal with India has been a matter of serious concern for us. Modiji and I took note of the outcome of the Commerce Secretary level meeting held last month in Kathmandu to jointly initiate a comprehensive review of the existing trade, transit and rail services treaties/agreements. I believe that India has both the capacity and willingness to address our genuine concern.
I requested Modiji to facilitate the exchange of demonetized currency notes held in the Nepali banking system and by general public at the earliest.
We agreed that the two transit facilitation related draft Letters of Exchange – one on bulk cargo and the other on Rail Services Agreement amendment would be finalized soon.
Considering the role of connectivity as a key enabler for development, we discussed the ways to enhance connectivity for our mutual benefit. We expressed satisfaction on the operationalization of the ICP in Birgunj and agreed to expedite progress on three other ICPs. The completion of the Hulaki road projects would receive added focus.
For the new electrified rail line to be built with the financial support of India, our respective agencies will carry out preparatory survey work at the earliest and finalize the implementation and funding modalities. In order to develop inland waterways for the movement of cargo, we shared the views that early start of the work is required. India will send its expert team soon for further study to implement the project.
I am fascinated by Modiji’s vision of HIT (highways, information ways and transmission ways). Two more dimensions to this would be pertinent: waterways and airways. As also discussed during my recent visit to India, I am expecting positive decision from India soon on our request for providing of four additional air entry routes to ease air traffic.
I am happy to note that the Indian side is preparing DPR for the motorable bridge over Mahakali River to connect Darchula and the construction work is expected to commence after the monsoon season. A joint survey is also on the card to prepare a detailed report regarding connectivity of the four-lane motorable bridge over Mahakali River for its connectivity with National Highway-9 in India.
I take this opportunity to express thanks to you Excellency Modiji personally and the Government of India for the support extended to us in the aftermath of the devastating earthquake of April 2015. Nepali agencies are actively involved in the implementation of the reconstruction projects with the support of India, both under grant and loan.
Earlier today, Modiji and I jointly launched the Nepal-India Ramayana Circuit in the premises of the Janaki Temple in Janakpur. This will connect Janakpur, the birthplace of Sita, the Ayodhya and other sites associated with the epic Ramayana. We also jointly flagged off the first bus service from Janakpur for Ayodhya.
I am delighted to mention that Modiji is also visiting Muktinath tomorrow. I am sure this will be inscribed in history as the first one by a foreign head of government to that holy abode of peace.
Both of us agreed that this visit of Prime Minister Modiji has further strengthened the age-old friendly relations between our two countries and has generated a fresh impetus to our bilateral cooperation and partnership.
We attach high importance to our relations with India and look forward to continued cooperation in the coming days for the mutual benefit of the two countries and peoples. In this respect, I look forward to working closely with Modiji in the days ahead.
Thank you very much.

‘Nepal-China Relations and Development Prospects in Trans-Himalayan Region’
Speech by Foreign Minister Pradeep Kumar Gyawali at Sichuan University, Chengdu
20 April 2018
 
Mr. Vice President of Sichuan University
Distinguished Professors
Members of Faculties
Researchers and Scientists
Dear Students and Scholars
Friends of Nepal
Ladies and Gentlemen
I would like to begin by thanking Sichuan University for inviting me to speak here this afternoon. As one of the earliest institutions of higher education in southwest China, Sichuan University has a rich history of pioneering research and educational reforms in China. The University has been at the forefront of supporting socio-economic development through education, and science and technology.
Its integrated multi-disciplinary approach to education and its emphasis on cultivating among the students qualities such as respect for humanity, drive for innovation and nurture international outlook are captured well by its motto, which says: Hai Na Bai Chuan, You Rong Nai Da (The Sea Receives Waters from All Rivers, and A Wise Man Listens to All Views).
Such noble gestures of welcome and acceptance are typical characteristics of Chinese culture. These profound values have played a great role in building the foundations not only of China’s great civilization but also, when speaking of cities like Chengdu, in developing vibrant cities of innovation and modernization through their eclectic, expansive and inclusive ambience.
Chengdu is the center of the Southern Silk Road. History tells us that ancient Sichuan, with Chengdu as its most important city, linked South Asia through Yunnan, Tibet, Nepal, Myanmar, India, and Thailand, and extended as far as the Middle East.
In the days ahead, we should build on these excellent roots of civilizational, geographical and cultural affinities to further connect our countries and societies in order to achieve common prosperity in the trans-Himalayan region.
Ladies and Gentlemen:
Many people are familiar with the Silk Road traveled by Marco Polo to reach Beijing in the thirteenth century. Basically, this route included Western and Central Asia, the Persian Gulf, and the ancient caravan route which is now Iran, Iraq and Turkmenistan, onward to the Gobi Desert before reaching the durbar of Kublai Khan in Beijing.
But there are other important Silk Routes as well. ‘The Trans-Himalayan Silk Road’ and ‘The Tea Horse Trail’ dating to millennia ago are ancient routes of great influence. Recent studies reveal that the grottoes of Dunawang of Gansu Province and Mustang of Nepal have similar characteristics and belong to the same time period. They leave us an onerous task of exploring the southern Silk Road stretching those two passes through Sichuan.
Nepal was an important lynchpin in that ancient Silk Road. The trans-Himalayan routes had immense influence on the life of a vast stretch of land extending from present-day western China, central China, Turkmenistan, Bamiyan (Afghanistan), Mongolia, Nepal, Bangladesh (Chittagong), Sri Lanka, and India (from Kolkata  to Kashmir).
The entourage of royal attendants of Princess Bhrikuti in the seventh century CE brought not only Budhhism but also Nepali craftsmanship to Tibet. Some of this cultural heritage traveled to other places in China, which can be witnessed even today. For example, the Lama Temple in Beijing as well as some temples in other places in China, contain ancient relics with Nepal’s indigenous Ranjana script. Similarly, the White Pagoda of Beijing is an excellent example of the expanse of Nepali architecture in China.
Ladies and Gentlemen:
The large-scale trade and cultural communication between South Western China and South Asia since ancient times contributed not just to cross-border trade and commerce but also to cross-civilizational cultural exchanges and cross-pollination of ideas across continents.
The wealth generated by the trans-Himalaya trade helped build marvelous architecture and monuments in Kathmandu, Lalitpur and Bhaktapur in Nepal. The Buddhist Newars of the Kathmandu valley were at the forefront of the entrepreneurial communities traveling to vast swathes of the Asian heartland. The influence of Nepali craftsmanship and trade was immense in Tibet and beyond. The pagodas, stupas and ancient Buddhist art Pauva from Nepal have great influence in Chinese society. The trans-Himalayan trade across the belt is also a classic example of exchange between two ecological zones.
The middle and lower regions of Nepal produce a surplus of grains, but suffer from a lack of salt. The arid Tibetan plateau that expands to Qinghai, Gansu, Yunnan and Sichuan, contains many salt-lakes but not much grain-producing lands or climatic conditions. The constant demand for grains on one side and for salt on the other provided a basis for stable exchange system, facilitating payment, credit and exchange. Those specializing in trade, transportation, storage and distribution could settle in otherwise inhospitable climates, and keep the caravan of trade moving.
That was the underlying logic of trade between our two countries.
Indeed, trade was an important pillar of the economies of both Nepal and western China in ancient time.
Unfortunately, the vibrant commercial exchange that underlined such a long history of cultural interface slowed down considerably by the beginning of 19th century with a slew of factors, including colonization and innovation of new technologies in Europe. Europe became the center of knowledge, economy and power.
The need of the day is to envisage a new paradigm of co-operation and commerce across the Himalayas for a win-win outcome, embedding such collaboration in the frame of bilateral co-operation between Nepal and China.
Nepal wishes to promote peace and prosperity through mutual co-operation in enhancing and deepening connectivity. Being the conduit for commerce the exchange of civilizations has been Nepal’s forte in the past. We want to lay renewed focus on this comparative advantage that we enjoyed in the past and is equally relevant at present with brighter prospect.
To this end, I propose to suggest the outlines of this new basis of trans-Himalayan co-operation initiatives.
Ladies and Gentlemen:
Thanks to the Belt and Road Initiative, the rich history of cultural and commercial exchange between Nepal and China is poised at revival and rejuvenation.
For Nepal, it is also a moment of pride as we work together with China in this historic mission for greater peace, prosperity and harmony.
The proposed BRI projects encompassing cross-border roads, railways, oil pipelines, information highways, energy grids, skyways and transmission highways should aim at utilizing the rich resources along the Himalayan range, and  improving the quality of lives of peoples in those areas.
The facilities and infrastructures thus created will not only raise the standards of living of the people residing in those far-flung areas, but also support conservation efforts and help overall development of that region.
During its long history, Nepal always prospered when commerce flourished, and its economy faltered when trade dwindled across the Himalayas. I am fully confident that as the Himalayan range re-emerges as a vital connecting link, Nepal’s trajectory of economic development will witness a rapid and positive transformation. It is my pleasure to share you that Nepal and China shared common views on developing a trans-Himalayan multi-dimensional transport network with long term vision during my meeting in Beijing early this week.
I would like to stress that the aspirations for development in Nepal will remain elusive without setting up a proper manufacturing base and manufacturing can’t be competitive without innovative industry in the country. The manufacturing industry with innovative activities not only raises productivity but also creates jobs for the people. The challenge for us is how to retain the youths who leave the country every day in large numbers in search of job overseas, by creating decent job opportunities at home.
Development of cross-border railways between Nepal and China is a priority for the Government of Nepal along with other connectivity related infrastructure. Coupled with their geographical proximity as well as the proposed infrastructural projects across the Himalayas, Nepal and China can work together in promoting economic activities in the Himalayan belt by creating systems of value-chains to their mutual advantage. I believe that China’s enormous manufacturing base, advance technology and its huge domestic market, together with Nepal’s rich natural, geographical and locational resources, will create the right mix of value chain and complement for continued economic growth.
Similarly, agriculture development is the areas where there is huge scope for co-operation between the two countries.
Dissemination of Chinese agricultural technologies in Nepal can raise overall production, crop yields and raise incomes for farmers, including for those who rely on high-altitude and high value farming. Mechanization of agriculture in Nepal’s fertile lands will enable Nepal to increase exports and create employment for its young people.  Chinese enterprises, on the other hand, will have opportunity to introduce and invest in advance technologies of agriculture production in Nepal to command fair return on their investment.
Similarly, Nepal has abundant natural resource endowments, whereas Chinese enterprises have the technological and financial resources for investments. We need to work assiduously to realize this vast potential opportunity for development. For example, hydropower has the potential to fundamentally transform Nepal’s developmental landscape, if exploited properly. Chinese enterprises have rich experience, capability, technology and fund to harness water resource for mutual benefit.
Chinese investors may utilize the investment opportunities in Nepal for mutual benefits.  The Government of Nepal is fully committed to providing security to Chinese investors.  Nepal enjoys duty-free-quota-free market access for its products in many developed and emerging economies. This could serve as an incentive for investors to invest in manufacturing sectors.
Resources such as forests and timber, herbs, cool climatic zones, are areas where we can develop together.
Tourism is an area where China and Nepal both can benefit through greater cooperation. Developing tourism services would be a promising area to forge bilateral collaboration for win-win cooperation since Nepal is endowed with natural beauty, cultural diversity and place for unique adventure not yet fully developed.
In the first three months of 2018  we received more than 36,000 tourists from China,  ranking it as top source country of tourists visiting Nepal.  Similarly, the number of Nepalis coming to China has increased in recent years. More than 6000 Nepalis are currently living in China, pursuing higher studies, or being engaged in employment and business.  Many Nepalis are beginning to choose China as a destination for travel and tourism. In addition, sizable numbers of Nepalis are also coming to China for leisure, training, study visits, sports activities, seminars and research programs.
These figures and activities indicate the magnitude and intensity of our ever growing contacts between Nepal and China at people to people level. Exchanges between peoples of the two countries are growing steadily. As 21st century’s diplomacy is focused on public diplomacy and cultural diplomacy, such exchanges will help both countries to nurture and sustain better understanding and goodwill and contribute for creating harmonious society.
Co-operation         and exchanges among academic institutions, think tank, research institutes and intellectuals between Nepal and China are equally important in order for optimizing and harmonizing the learning and development endeavor in either place. Production of knowledge for continued vitality of economic activities is the most essential ingredient and integral part of development endeavor. Sichuan University can play vital role in that area.  I appreciate the Sichuan University for their efforts to go beyond border and collaborate with the universities in south Asia that includes Nepal. I also would like to thank the University for providing learning opportunities and platform to the academicians, students, and researchers of Nepal and substantially contributing for their capacity building endeavor.
Dear Friends,
China is a global economic powerhouse, which gives it an important role to play in promoting world peace, development and stability.
In this context, we appreciate China’s efforts at forging co-operative links between countries in the region and beyond. We appreciate the role of the BRI as an initiative aimed at addressing the infrastructural and structural bottlenecks of development. Building cross-border infrastructure is very important for landlocked countries like ours. We expect the Belt and Road Initiative to contribute to our development efforts.
Additionally, connectivity will help Nepal exploit the full potentials of its economic possibilities. Connectivity lies at the core of all development activities.
Meanwhile, it will also help cement our ties through enhanced people-to-people relations.
 In the past five years, we have seen phenomenal political, economic, and technological changes globally and in the region.
Among these significant developments has been China’s various innovative programs and institutions for global growth and harmony under the broader theme of Belt and Road Initiative.
Time is ripe now to revive the ancient glory acquired from exchanges between Nepal and China. Nepal stands ready to work together for trade and economic integration towards common prosperity.
The development of infrastructures along the trans-Himalayan region is critical for promoting economic opportunities by ensuring efficient movement of people, services and goods across the region.
To attain this goal, cooperation and understanding is required to optimize the benefits of trans-Himalayan connectivity.
Therefore, Nepal and China should focus their cooperation arrangement for building the critical infrastructure in the Himalayan region and remove the barriers for a seamless movement of people, goods and services.
We have already reached an understanding to work together to attain this goal at the earliest, and I do believe that we will reach there soon.
Dear Friends, Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen,
Before concluding, let me share with you my conviction that Nepal and China are set to gear up their cooperation to a new height for mutual benefit and win–win outcomes.
At a time of historic socio-economic transformation across the globe where poverty levels have fell down to record lows and global prosperity has shored, we cannot afford to let underdevelopment and poverty wean the talents and promise of people anywhere in the world.
It was in this spirit that I discussed the scope of further enhancing co-operation between Nepal and China with the leaders of China during my current visit. And I am very happy to share with you that China, as always, has remained an enthusiastic supporter of our efforts at national development.
I would like to appreciate the South Asia Institute of Sichuan University for their continued efforts to promote Nepal-China relations.
With this note, I also would like to thank you all for your presence and kind attention.
Long live Nepal-China Friendship!
Thank you!

‘Nepal-China Relations in the Twenty-First Century’
 Speech by Foreign Minister Pradeep Kumar Gyawali at Roundtable organized by China Reform Forum, Beijing
19 April 2018
Mr. Chairman
Friends of Nepal
Ladies and Gentlemen
Let me begin by thanking China Reform Forum for inviting me to address this Roundtable and share my thoughts on Nepal-China relations on the occasion of my first official visit to China as the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Nepal.
I am glad to learn that the Forum has been making enormous contributions to the policy-making process through informed policy recommendations.
I am sure that there are many areas of development policy where think-tanks in Nepal and China can cooperate together for achieving better development outcomes.
In the process, it will also advance our relations further through exchanges of research findings and scholar’s exchanges.
In my remarks today, I will first highlight the glorious history of Nepal-China relations, Nepal’s policy on its relations with China, and then briefly touch upon our development challenges before concluding with what I consider should be the priorities of Nepal-China relations in the 21st century.
Dear Friends:
The history of Nepal-China relations goes long beyond the formal establishment of our diplomatic relations in1955.
The roots of Nepal-China relations may be traced back to the caravan trade millennia ago. This so-called ‘Tea Horse Trail’ that originated in South West China and passed through tortures mountain passes to the vast swath of southern slope of Himalayas, connecting Nepal and China, was a thoroughfare for civilizational exchanges. Our ancestors took risks to traversing mighty Himalayas in pursuit of better life and significantly contributed for advancement of civilization across them.
The retinue of traders, horsemen and caravan plying this route brought not only Buddhism but also other features of Nepali culture and craftsmanship to China through Tibet, Yunnan, and Sichuan and beyond.
No surprise then that Nepal’s Ranjana script is found in ancient relics housed in the Jiangxi and Beijing.
Recent scholarship has corroborated such historical interface, and shown that there existed intense cultural exchange and commercial interchange between South Western China and Nepal since ancient times.
This exchange facilitated not just cross-cultural understanding and cross-fertilization of ideas but also proliferation of profound civilizational values of acceptance, plurality and inclusivity as preached by Buddhism and Confucius alike. Lord Buddha’s teachings have profoundly impacted the socio-cultural lives of the Nepali and Chinese peoples.
There is a long history of social contact like travel of Faxian, Buddhabhadra and Xuan Zan across the Himalayas from early 5th century to 7th century AD. Their travelogue and translations have richly contributed in disseminating Buddha’s teachings in China.
Likewise, Bhrikuti, the Nepali princess married to Tibetan prince Song-tsen-Gampo in the 7th century, helped greatly to spread Budhhism across China.
Araniko, popularly known as ‘Anige’, upon invitation of Emperor Kublai Khan, travelled all the way from Nepal to Beijing in the 13th century and built the famous White Pagoda, also known as BáitǎSì, which is still standing high in the heart of Beijing reflecting deep rooted friendship between the two countries.
Dear Friends:
Such extra-ordinary relations between our two countries based on historical legacy and geographical logic have gained great momentum in the sixty-two years of diplomatic relations.
The governments of the two countries have established several institutional mechanisms for regular dialogue. The regular exchange of visits at high levels has contributed in deepening mutual understanding and communication at top levels.
Our cultural, trade and economic relations are growing fast even though we have yet to fully resolve several challenges such as burgeoning trade deficit and infrastructural constraints.
Our people-to-people relations are growing equally fast. This was in full display following the devastating earthquake of 2015 that killed around 9000 people and left thousands homeless in Nepal.
As the Chinese saying goes, ‘Only when the year grows cold do we see that the pine and cypress are the last to fade; only when we get into trouble do we know who our genuine friends are’.
China is a real, trusted friend for Nepal, and this was amply demonstrated in the aftermath of the earthquake.
The prompt support and assistance Nepal received from China for rescue and relief as well for reconstruction was overwhelming and unprecedented.
Nepali people fondly recall the generous support accorded by Chinese people and government be it for any natural or man-made crises Nepal faces or be it for the socio-economic development of the country.
In turn, the Government and the people of Nepal have always stood with China in times of need and in the international forums. One China policy and not allowing anti-Chinese activities in our soil forms the core of our friendship with China. On China’s part, it has consistently and firmly supported Nepal’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence, faithfully observing the principle of non-interference in our internal affairs.
Our relations are based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and their sincere pursuit by both countries has made us  trusted friends and reliable partners. Our relationship is marked by mutual trust, understanding, goodwill, cooperation and appreciation of and respect for each other’s concerns and sensitivities.
Today, we are among the founding members of AIIB and a partner under the Belt and Road Initiative, both China-led global initiatives. That is the level of commitment we have for China, and will always remain so.
We admire China’s neighbourhood diplomacy guided by the principles of sincerity, amity, mutual benefit and inclusiveness. Nepal also attaches highest importance to its relations with neighbours.
Nepal takes pride in seeing China’s growing profile on the world stage, both politically and economically. China’s role is very important in shaping global agenda for a just and equitable world order.
We strongly believe that Nepal-China friendship will always be in the interest of our two countries and people. Territorial size, population and level of development have never been the elements of constrain in defining Nepal-China friendship.  Rather, sovereign equality and mutual respect have always remained at the centre, buttressing our cooperative partnership.
Dear Friends:
This is the state of overall Nepal-China relations today. We are proud of this. Nepal’s least developed status is a matter of serious concern for us. We have achieved fundamental transformation in political realm. An era of political stability has just begun in Nepal. Achieving the same level of transformation in economic realm would be our topmost agenda ahead. We have defined our motto, “Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali” and all our activities will be directed towards this end. In realizing this goal, we count on support and cooperation from our trusted friend China. China has been a reliable partner in Nepal’s development journey for a long period of time. We believe that Nepal-China partnership for economic development is very crucial for us to realize our national development aspirations.
From a forward looking perspective, we need to identify the areas where Nepal and China need to focus their collective efforts in the days ahead.
The world has undergone phenomenal changes in the past six decades of Nepal-China diplomatic relations. Innovations in every field, and unprecedented development in transportation, and information technology have made profound impacts in human life. China has emerged as an economic power house with global vision of inclusive and harmonious development. The world’s poverty incidence has gone down significantly for which China deserves special mention since it has succeeded in lifting 700 million people out of poverty. In the sectors of railways transportation, sharing economy, online payments, and e-commerce, as well as artificial intelligence, energy and agriculture productivity, China has made unparalleled progress. With a growing role in international relations for global peace and harmony, China has emerged as a major factor of global stability and growth. On the other hand, Nepal too is endowed with enormous potential with 30m population and abundant natural resource endowment, cultural diversity, natural beauty and relatively agile diligent youthful population.  Being a most diverse topography ranging from the top of the world to almost sea level flat land within an aerial distance of 150 km, Nepal is a resource-rich country.  There are many areas where Nepal and China can complement each other for mutual prosperity.
To my mind, there are five interlocking areas where we should work together for achieving rapid economic prosperity.

Transport and Connectivity

In his visit to China in March 2016, Prime Minister K. P. Sharma Oli laid top priority on promoting connectivity between our two countries. This was because infrastructural deficiencies have prevented the full potentials of trade, commerce and people to people contacts between the second largest economy of the world – China – and Nepal from being fully realized.
It has, in the process, also prevented Nepal to benefit, to the maximum extent possible, from the rapid economic growth in the immediate neighbourhood of China. Transit facility from China will leverage Nepal from transit bottleneck in our international trade. Therefore, connecting through rail, road, power, telecommunication, airways and connecting Nepal to outside world through China are the topmost priority agendas for fully harnessing the unleashed potential within us.
I believe that such connectivity will have transformative impact on development in Nepal’ in pursuit of economic growth and social progress. Thus it will herald a new era in Nepal’s economic development. In this connection, the concept of trans-Himalayan multi-dimensional transport network with long term perspective was agreed during my meeting with H.E. Wang Yi, State Councilor and Minister of Foreign Affairs of China yesterday. We reached a common consensus that the development of this network will bring prosperity in the trans-Himalayan region and beyond.

 Agriculture, Industries and Technology Transfer

Agriculture is the mainstay of our economy, as 2/3 of our population is dependent on agriculture. However, it is a pity that the country has become a food importer from what it used to be a net food exporter.
Dissemination of Chinese agricultural technologies and mechanization of agriculture in order to improve productivity and efficiency in production,  is the area where Chinese enterprises can explore the opportunity. As I have mentioned earlier paragraph Nepal is the virgin land where we can produce a product of our choice in natural environment due to climatic variations and vegetations Nepal embodies.

 Unlocking Human Potentials

In terms of population, Nepal is among the middle-sized countries in the world. Its approximately 30 million people have 30 million dreams, of having a stable and prosperous society within their own lifetimes. Nepal has relatively young, economically active and agile population of which 60% are between the ages of 15 to 60 years and is one of the highest among the developing countries. China and Nepal can work together to utilize this resourceful population for creativity and resilience for stimulating economic activities in Nepal and China through production value chain.
Unlocking the full potentials of the human capital in Nepal will herald a new era in Nepal’s economic development.

 Natural Resources and Environment 

Nepal’s rich renewable natural resources, particularly aquatic resources and, cultural diversity, adventure tourism and scenic beauty, are significant, and are likely to evolve into an important pillar of co-operation between the two countries. Nepal is listed on the best tourism destinations in the world by various rating agencies in the past several successive years including best value destination by lonely planet in 2017 and Kathmandu as one of the most interesting visiting place to visit in 2018 by rough guide.
Theoretically Nepal can produce 83000 MW of hydropower of which about 1% is exploited so far till now. Power development is another area that Nepal can offer with tremendous potential for cooperation.  China has technology, capital and experience in the area. Nepal and China can work together for mutually beneficial cooperation.
Nepal possesses vast resources of high value medicinal herbs, forests and timber, which can be harnessed together.

 Trade and Investment

There are several areas under Belt and Road Initiative in the fields of trade, commerce and investment which hold great promise for co-operation between Nepal and China.
Trade is the engine of growth, and investment is the propeller of that engine.
As we saw before, both Nepal and China, as important parts of the ancient Silk Road Belt, have benefited in the past from vibrant trade and commerce in the region.
Nepal has been adopting a policy of economic liberalization since the early 1990s where all economic policies are set to a liberal framework.
To take advantage of the investment opportunities in Nepal, both the governments should encourage Chinese investments in the most promising sectors such as infrastructure development, hydropower, agriculture and minerals, and tourism.
There are high hopes in Nepal on the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) put forward by President H. E. Xi Jinping. The BRI aims to have peace and prosperity in the region and beyond, which holds far-reaching implications for the development of its neighbours.
Dear Friends: 
In Nepal, our focus is on strengthening inclusive growth.
As Nepal draws out from a long transition and moves towards graduating from LDC status by 2022 and acquiring a middle income status by 2030, we need to move with great speed and vision.
For that, Nepal will have to focus on promising sector such as hydro-power, industries, tourism, and agriculture as well as gainful employment of the youth population.
A comprehensive economic partnership between Nepal and China will help achieve these goals quickly and sustainably.
This is the vision I have for Nepal-China relations in the era of 21st century. The vision is one of common development and common efforts. It is a vision of shared prosperity through mutual support and collaboration.
I believe all of you assembled here will agree with me that a stable and prosperous Nepal will be in the long-term interest not only of Nepal and China, but also the entire region.
Let me therefore conclude by emphasizing the crucial role of close economic partnership in further cementing Nepal-China ties.
I thank you all for your kind attention and participation.
Thank You.

Statement by  Hon. Mr. Pradeep Kumar Gyawali,
Minister for Foreign Affairs of Nepal, during the Joint Press Address with H.E. Mr. Wang Yi,
State Councilor and Minister of Foreign Affairs of China
(Beijing, 18 April 2018)
State Councilor and Foreign Minister His Excellency Mr. Wang Yi
 Dear friends from media,
 Ladies and Gentleman, 

This is my first visit to China as the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Nepal. This is my first bilateral visit. I have come to China after the formation of the new Government following the successful holding of elections of all three tiers of federal set up under the new constitution. I am thankful to the Government of China for the kind invitation and for the warm welcome and generous hospitality extended to me and my delegation.
As State Councilor and Foreign Minister His Excellency Wang Yi just stated, we held very fruitful and comprehensive talks covering all important aspects of Nepal-China relations today. I am satisfied with the outcome of bilateral talks. I found genuine willingness on the part of the Government of China to support in our development efforts to make Nepal a prosperous country.
Neighborhood constitutes topmost priority in our foreign policy. We attach great importance to our relations with China. In line with our principled position, I reiterated Nepal’s firm commitment to One China policy. We have the policy of non-interference in the internal affairs of any other countries. We appreciate China’s neighborhood diplomacy guided by the principle of sincerity, amity, mutual benefit and inclusiveness. Our relations are guided by the ‘Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence’. Friendliness, cordiality, understanding, mutual cooperation, and appreciation of and respect for each other’s aspirations and sensitivities are the hallmarks of our relationship.
Nepal and China have made significant strides in recent years. We have agreed to seize the available opportunities in both countries to take Nepal-China bilateral relations to a new level for mutual benefits.
We comprehensively reviewed the progress made in the implementation of the agreements reached during the recent high-level visits including the visit of the Rt. Hon. Prime Minister Mr. K. P. Sharma Oli to China in March 2016. Transit Transport Agreement and MoU on Launching the Joint Feasibility Study of Nepal-China FTA are among the key instruments signed during the visit. We exchanged our views on the draft protocol to the Transit Transport Agreement and agreed to intensify negotiations in the coming days for its early finalization. I requested His Excellency Foreign Minister to take supportive measures to correct the huge trade imbalance faced by Nepal in its trade with China.
We also shared views on the implementation of MoU on Cooperation under the BRI. Nepal has expectation that the Initiative should contribute to the development of physical infrastructures, enhancing cross-border connectivity including railways and roads, promotion of trade, tourism and investment, and people-to-people relations. We shared our common views on the development of cross-border multi-dimensional transportation network.
Nepal has undergone transformation of historic proportions in the last one decade. Our constitution is fully operational now with the conclusion of all elections and formation of Government at the centre and provinces with strong majority. Nepal has now entered into an era of peace, stability and development. The present Government’s topmost agenda ahead is economic transformation for the prosperity of the people of Nepal with the motto “Prosperous Nepal and Happy Nepalis”. In order to achieve these goals, the present Government of Nepal has accorded high priority to connectivity, which includes railways, highways, info ways and transmission lines between Nepal and China. We want partnership with China in these areas for mutual benefits in the coming days.
We agreed to continue the regular exchange of high level visits and agreed to regularly convene the meetings of the established bilateral mechanisms.
I thanked the Chinese Government for continuously supporting us in our development efforts. Through our joint efforts, important works have been initiated recently including the agreement to mobilize RMB 2 billion for projects related to reconstruction including Arniko Highway Repair Project and reconstruction projects for cross border bridges in Tatopani and Rasuwagadhi. We stressed the need for an early reopening of the Tatopani-Zhangmu port linking the Arniko Highway. We also agreed to upgrade existing border ports.
We discussed about the early conduct of feasibility study and preparation of DPR of Nepal-China Cross Border Railway line stretching from Keyrong to Kathmandu and from Kathmandu to Pokhara and Lumbini.
We agreed, in principle, to establish a coordination and implementation mechanism for identifying projects of mutual interest and benefit and to facilitating the effective implementation of the Chinese government’s aided projects.
We also agreed to make joint efforts for tourism promotion of Nepal. We expect the support of the Chinese Government in publicizing the major tourist destinations of Nepal in major Chinese cities.
We also shared our views and ideas on continuing our cooperation at regional and international forums on matters of common interest.
It has been a rewarding and fruitful meeting. I thank, once again, State Councilor and Minister for Foreign Affairs H.E. Wang Yi for providing me this excellent opportunity. I have invited His Excellency Wang to visit Nepal at his earliest convenience to continue our dialogue further.

Thank you.

Remarks by Foreign Minister Pradeep K Gyawali atReception at Embassy of Nepal, Beijing 17 April 2018
Posted onApril 17, 2018April 17, 2018 


Ambassador Paudyal,
 Representatives of the diplomatic corps in Beijing,
 Members of the Nepali community in China, Media-persons, and Friends:
I am glad to be here amongst you this evening.
I arrived in Beijing this morning for my first official visit to China as Minister of Foreign Affairs.
I bring with me the greetings and best wishes of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, and the Government and people of Nepal, to President Xi Jinping, Premier Li Keqiang, and the Government and people of China.
The people of Nepal extend their sincere congratulations to the Chinese people for the remarkable achievements of the past 7 decades of nation building and the four decades of opening up and reform.
I myself would like to congratulate the Chinese Communist Party, as well as the Government and the people of China for successful conclusion of 19th CPC congress in October 2017 and the two sessions in March 2018 that have come up with major policies of opening up and inclusive development for shared benefits.
Nepal is happy to witness the peaceful development of China and sees greater prospects for global economic development and stability with increased involvement of China in managing global affairs based on principles of peaceful coexistence, Pancha Sheela”.
Nepal too has made historic achievements in the political realms in the past year by successfully concluding all the major milestones mandated by the Constitution through the successful holding of the three tiers of elections.
The concept of grassroots government as envisaged by the Constitution is finally a reality.
We now have a government that commands the confidence of more than 2/3rd members of the Parliament.
More importantly, we have embarked on the road of durable peace, political stability, and socio-economic transformation.
The vision propounded by PM Oli as “Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepalis” is the vision of a society where people will enjoy decent lives and the young people will have productive jobs.
We are fully confident that we will achieve our cherished goals of creating a peaceful, stable and prosperous society in the foreseeable future.
Dear Friends:
We greatly value our relations with China and appreciate the continued support to the people of Nepal by China irrespective of major political changes in Nepal and changes in the outside world.
Tomorrow, I will hold a bilateral-level talk with State Councilor and Minister for Foreign Affairs H.E. Wang Yi and also call on the state leaders during my stay in Beijing.
I will also visit Chengdu and meet provincial leaders for cooperation before leaving for Nepal.
We will discuss all aspects of Nepal-China relations, and exchange views on further expanding and deepening them.
I will also emphasize the significance of frequent exchanges of high level political visits for further strengthening relations of trust and friendship.
Dear friends,
Last year, Nepal and China signed an MoU on co-operation under the Belt and Road Initiative.
Earlier in 2016 we signed a number of agreements and reached  various understandings for promoting mutually beneficial cooperation.
In 2017, Vice-President Rt. Hon’ble Nanda Bahadur Pun and Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’ visited China.
Deputy Prime Minister Krishna Bahadur Mahara paid two visits during the same period.
Vice-Premier of China H.E. Wang Yang paid a very important and productive visit to Nepal in 2017.
Similarly, Chinese investors have been showing keen interest in investing in Nepal, and the number of Chinese tourists visiting Nepal is also increasing rapidly.
These activities have enhanced Nepal-China co-operative relations, and we should keep up the momentum.
In this context, I am happy to note that Nepal-China co-operation has been expanding in multiple directions in recent years and there is great potential to expand it.
We need to enhance them further in the spirit of good neighborliness and friendliness for mutual benefit.
Dear Friends:
To make the vision of a prosperous Nepal a reality, we will focus on laying the physical, economic and social infrastructure and exploit the full potentials of the rich resource endowments that we are blessed with.
To attain this noble objective, we need the support and understanding of all, including the Nepali nationals residing abroad.
I invite all Nepalis, both at home and abroad, to contribute from their respective ends to realize this momentous goal of nation-building.
Dear Friends:
Today, we launched the book “The Selected Speeches of Prime Minister KP Oli”, translated into Chinese.
The publication of this anthology reflects the interest in China regarding Nepal’s recent political developments. Readers of this publication will learn of Prime Minister Oli’s views on important contemporary issues as well as his vision for a prosperous and forward-looking Nepal.
I express my sincerest thanks to Pangoal Institute and South Asian Institute of Sichuan University for their initiative and support in bringing out this publication.
Dear Friends, Ladies and Gentlemen:
Before I conclude, let me share with you that China has been very supportive of the all-round development of Nepal and such support and goodwill has been of crucial significance.
We look forward to similar support, goodwill and understanding in the days ahead as we embark on the road of socio-economic development in the country.
Let me also express my sincere appreciation to the Embassy for its efforts in strengthening Nepal-China relations through its activities.
With these few words, I would like to express my sincere thanks to you all for your presence here today, and wish you all the best!
Thank you!

Statement by The Right Honourable Mr K. P. Sharma Oli, Prime Minister of Nepal at Govind Ballabh Panth University of Agriculture and Technology
08 April 2018
Professor A.K. Mishra, Vice Chancellor of the University
Distinguished Professors
Members of Faculties
Scientists, Researchers 
Dear Students and Scholars 
Friends of Nepal
Ladies and Gentlemen 
I would like to begin by thanking the University for conferring this honorary doctorate on me today. I accept your kind award, with profound gratitude.
I express my sincere thanks to you, Professor A.K. Mishra, for extending the generous invitation to me to join all of you at this University; the first Agriculture University of India; the university which heralded a revolution in agricultural education, research and innovation; a center of excellence which has led renaissance in agriculture education in India.
I feel profoundly impressed to be here at the university which has contributed to transforming the agricultural landscape of India. I am equally inspired to stand at this podium and address a rich cross-section of erudite scholars, agricultural scientists, professors, students (as well as dexterous peasants).
Ladies and Gentlemen 
Education which inculcates not only information but also cultivates wisdom and spurs innovation.
Education which can rekindle the spirit, inform the intellect, and shape the mind.
The mind of a human being has infinite potential, of which only a fraction is used.
The mind is a citadel where the faculties of infinite imagination, innovation and invention are cultivated. And, it is education that unleashes the potential of brain.
To extend the envelops and open new vistas of brilliance, education is the key.
Equally rich is the nature’s potential. The potential to nurture as well as nourish. The potential to propel the raft of prosperity. And, it is an educated mind that unleashes the very potential of nature.
To harness the resourcefulness of nature, education is the key.
Each individual has distinct interest and capacity; has unique aptitude and ability. The onus lies in the State to confer an individual with the suitable opportunity to build on those skills.
It is the responsibility of the government to assess the human resource requirements of the nation and harness the talents that its people have.
It is the responsibility of an individual as well to put the service of his knowledge for the benefit of broader society, and the nation.
True, education makes an individual a better person. However, its utility doesn’t end there. Education should also contribute to the solemn goal of nation-building as well.
Ladies and Gentlemen, Dear Friends  
The heritage of wisdom and knowledge that our countries carry is enormous. Our progenitors were pioneers in education, in innovation. They were the key figures in art, literature, and culture.
Their diligence and dedication conceived an unshakable foundation of our civilization – one infused with innovation, with creative ingenuity, with inspiring inventions. It is our region which cultivated the learned rishis and munis, saints and sages, great philosophers, and truth-seekers.
Our ancestors gave the world the profound wisdom of Vedas and Upanishads, yoga and Ayurveda, grammar, and linguistics.  They gifted the world with mathematics and algebra. They taught the eternal teachings of ahimsa to the humanity.
They imagined. They envisioned. And, they innovated. Their wisdom has survived the test of time. Our region conceived many geniuses who inspired the human civilization and guided the evolution of humanity from darkness to light.
In the annals of the evolution of knowledge and innovation, the name of our fore-bearers stands out bright and illustrious.
The duty falls upon us to carry that torch ahead.
The responsibility lies with us to keep the heritage of that knowledge alive and march ahead. To explore and advance the genetic memory that we have inherited from our ancestors.
In our times, the world has seen a tectonic shift in technological change and innovation. Astounding strides have been made in the industrial development. The incidence of poverty has decreased significantly. The indicators of human development are getting better. The death from communicable disease and epidemics have decreased. School enrollment has gone up. The opportunities in front of us are manifold.
However, challenges abound.
The world we live in today is a better place, but this should not lull us into any complacency. There is much to be done to make the world realize its potential, to harness the potential of human ingenuity.
There are many maladies to cure; hurdles to cross; and deeds to be done.
The responsibility lies with us, to ensure that the fruit of development is shared by all, and roots of development are sustainable and inclusive.
The responsibility lies with us, to break the development bottlenecks by investing in infrastructure.
While we focus our priority to address these issues, we should redouble our efforts to invest in technical education. Our educational institutes have the onus to serve as a hub to produce more innovators, inventors, and entrepreneurs.
Dear Friends
A major source of employment in Nepal, agriculture remains a key pillar of our economy. As elsewhere in our region, it plays a fundamental role in ensuring food and nutrition security in Nepal. Almost 65% of our population depends on agriculture and its contribution to the GDP is 33%. Promoting sustainable and high yielding agriculture remains a top priority of national development agenda.
The government is determined to transform the agriculture in Nepal by utilizing the technical progress, while also making the best use of traditional knowledge and genetic resources.
In the quest of transforming the agriculture in Nepal through enhancing agricultural production and productivity, science-based agricultural growth driven by vibrant, efficient and effective national agricultural research, education and extension system is essential.   
Educational institutions, like this university, can best serve this purpose by capitalizing in technological progress while preserving the genetic memory.
And also, a close collaboration between Nepal and India can facilitate the agricultural development by the expansion of the market. We can work in the areas of improved seed, irrigation, soil improvement, mechanization, and crop diversification.
 Ladies and Gentlemen 
I visited India in 2015 as the first Prime Minister elected after the promulgation of the Constitution, the constitution adopted by a democratically elected body which institutionalized our political transformation.
And this time, I am on a visit as the first Prime Minister elected after the conclusion of constitutionally mandated elections of all the three levels – federal, provincial and local. With the participation of all sections of societies, these elections have heralded a new era of stability, and a new era of added responsibility.
A responsibility to prioritize economic transformation.
A responsibility to unleash the potential of human mind as well as resourcefulness of nature.
Now, our focus is to accelerate development and prosperity, where no-one is left behind. And I say this with a confidence that, a developed and prosperous Nepal is in the interest of her neighbours as well.
Before concluding, I would like to stress on the need to promote enhanced collaboration and cooperation between the Govind Ballabh Pant University of Agriculture and Technology and universities in Nepal for undertaking studies and research on issues that are common to us.
I would share with you that Prime Minister Modiji and I jointly launched Nepal-India New Partnership in Agriculture. Hope this will result in an enhanced level of cooperation between our two friendly countries.
With this note, I would like to thank you, Prof. A.K. Mishra, and the university, once again, for conferring this honorary doctorate on me.
I thank you all for your kind attention!

Speech by Rt. Hon’ble Mr. K P Sharma Oli, Prime Minister of Nepal at the Civic Reception organized by India Foundation in New Delhi, April 7, 2018
Posted onApril 7, 2018April 7, 2018 

“Nepal-India Relations in 21st Century“
Mr. Chairman,
Excellencies,
Friends of Nepal,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I feel honoured to be here amidst this enlightened gathering. I consider this as a distinct privilege.
I am thankful to India Foundation for providing this occasion to share my humble thoughts on the future prospects of Nepal-India relations and broader geopolitical context surrounding us.
Two years back I was in this great city on my first State visit to India as Nepal’s Prime Minister. My country had then just accomplished the historic task of promulgating the Constitution through a democratic process of the elected Constituent Assembly.
That was an important moment. We were living behind the long and costly period of political transition and uncertainties, anticipating a stable political course ahead. As the Prime Minister of the country, I had the huge responsibility to carry forth the tasks related to the implementation of the Constitution that was just born. The task was demanding; challenges colossal.
Thanks to the wisdom and perseverance of fellow Nepali leadership and the 28 million Nepali people as well as support and solidarity of friends from neighbourhood and around the world, we have achieved all major milestones in constitution implementation in the past two years. And this time, I am visiting India as Nepal’s Prime Minister elected through the first ever polls held under the Constitution; as the leader of a country that looks to future with resounding optimism and abounding dreams.
The local, provincial and federal elections held in 2017 were historic in many ways. Following these, we were able to have elected representatives in all 753 local level bodies after a gap of nearly two decades. And, provincial elections are entirely new.
A major political transformation envisaged in the Constitution was the restructuring of the State into federal set up. For the first time in our history, we now have seven provincial assemblies and provincial governments. ‘Government at doorstep’ is our constitutional spirit, which has now been structurally realized.
The elections were hugely participative and results were inclusive. Voters’ turnout was over 70 percent in average. Through the elections, we have been able to ensure over 41 percent of women representation in elected bodies. This is not a small achievement by any standard. And, our intention is to bridge the remaining 9 percent gap.
With this political process completed, we now have embarked on the path of political stability. All provincial governments command support of two third majority in their respective assemblies and my government at the centre has robust mandate and overwhelming support.
I have deemed this as a mandate to work for the long-cherished socio-economic transformation of the country. Ours is the dream of a prosperous Nepal where people will have decent living and youths will have decent jobs; where our infrastructure will be better and our vast, untapped resources will be converted into economic benefits and wealth. It’s a dream of overcoming the vicious circle of poverty, underdevelopment and social backwardness.
We are mindful, however, that we alone cannot undertake this journey to prosperity. We will continue to count on support, solidarity and goodwill from friends all over the world, particularly our neighbours.
I say neighbours as they, by virtue of geographic proximity and long historic associations, are the ones who understand us well and are cognizant of our development needs. I say neighbours as, fortunately for us, they have been able to register marvellous achievements when it comes to development and hence, they are our inspirations, our lessons and key source of support.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Nepal and India are connected by geography as well as history, by our religions as well as culture.
Our relations are blessed by the wisdom of saints and sages. Our bonds are strengthened by both physical connectivity and people-to-people interactions in almost all spheres.
Our relations began even before the history began to be recorded; they began in the dawn of human civilization in this part of the world.
Today, in this 21st century, our age-old relations have expanded to a more extensive, and multidimensional connection.
It is a neighbourhood reality that we often witness intermittent glitches in our relations. It is a fact that we have witnessed difficult times in our relations. We have gone through the cycles of ups and downs; highs and lows in our relations. I am sharing this frankly because open discussions help improve the thrust and course of relationship. We, leaders on both sides, are capable to review and introspect where things went wrong and how we could do better in future.
And the history implores us to take our relations to newer vistas of opportunities, to newer heights of mutual benefits. In this mission, it is natural that we have certain expectations from India as a large neighbour and a country with rising global stature in many ways.
Relations between neighbours differ from that of others. Neighbourhood realities are distinct in many respects and accordingly dictate the terms of overall engagements. Good neighbourliness demands harmonious co-existence forever. And, trust is the key cementing factor. It derives its strength from the observance of such fundamental principles as equality, justice, mutual respect and benefit as well as non-interference.
As friendly neighbours, our two countries need to be aware of, and respect for, each other’s concerns and sensitivities. Nepal has not allowed its land to be used against the sovereign interests of India. We are firm in our resolve to maintain this position. And it is natural that we expect similar assurance from India.
We are in the changed context both at home and abroad. Our domestic political realties dictate the values and course of our action both internally and externally. We have defined our goals, priorities, strategies and actions for nation-building. Likewise, we want to inject fresh perspectives into our relations with external world.
Our foreign policy priority begins at our borders. Talking about India, our foreign policy objective is to strengthen the foundation of relations, but not to weaken it; objective is to expand and consolidate relations, but not to limit the scope or unravel it; and objective is to bring our relations to the next level, but not to slide back. Our objective is clear. Our intention is pure. Our determination is strong. And, our efforts will be robust.
Stability and predictability in relationship is very important for us. Because we are two countries of different size, populations, and level of economic development. And our ambition is different, so is our strength. India is aspiring to be a global power, both politically and economically. Nepal’s ambition is to be a prosperous place.
 Distinguished participants,
We cherish India’s progresses and prosperity. Its accomplishments in many spheres are notable. The wonderful journey of India as a major economic powerhouse is an inspiration for many people around the world and more so in our neighbourhood.
For Nepal, India remains the largest trading partner. However, the problem of bilateral trade deficit looms large. Our economy cannot sustain alarmingly high trade imbalance with India. Its continuance will pose a serious threat to our economy. We are not a competitor of India. We need a breathing space. I am sure many of you would agree when I say that helping Nepal to be economically strong serves India’s vital interest.
Therefore, we need to focus our attention to diversify our trade basket and scale up the volume of exports from Nepal to India.  The provisions of the 1996 Trade Treaty were highly supportive for Nepal’s trade. The Treaty’s initial period was an encouraging period in our trade relationship. Measures such as removal of quantitative restrictions, tariff quota reduction and downward revision of value addition criteria, simplification and streamlining of procedures and easy access to quarantine and testing facilities could ease the difficult situation.
To increase the flow of goods and augment trade, we need to invest in infrastructures and streamline the procedures as well.
India has extended generous assistance to finance development endeavours of Nepal. It has helped to diversify our economy, build up the infrastructure, and enhance our industrial base. However, there is much to do to scale up our economic cooperation and timely delivery of agreed projects.
To further intensify the economic cooperation, we must create the stories of success; we must translate our pledges into performance.
Nepal’s hydropower development is an important sector for bilateral partnership. It will benefit the people and industries of both of our countries. We need to generate a success story by sincerely implementing the projects agreed in the past such as Pancheshwor in its true spirit.
Nepal is a desired destination for Indian tourists. Attracted by the natural heritage as well as religious sites, Indian tourists can further contribute to Nepal’s economy.
To enhance the flow of people, for enterprise as well as tourism – we need to further expand air connectivity and road and rail linkages. Cross-border connectivity is very important to unleash development potentials and to spur growth.
The importance of connectivity cannot be overemphasized for a landlocked country like ours. India has been providing overland transit facilities to Nepal for international trade. When I talk about connectivity I recall what Prime Minister Modiji eloquently highlighted the idea of HIT (highways, information ways and transmission ways) while addressing the Legislature-Parliament of Nepal during his first visit to Nepal in August 2014. We need to realize this vision.
As connectivity is important for all of us, we underline the need for developing regional and sub-regional connectivity arrangements. We need to ensure that bilateral as well as regional connectivity and transit arrangements run smoothly without any interruption at all times. Recourse to obstacles in the movement of goods, services and people should not have any place in today’s interconnected world and in interconnected neighbourhood.
Dear Friends,
We are living in an interesting time in terms of the shifting power equation in the world and the transformed geopolitical orientation.
Asia’s centrality in today’s world stage has been affirmed by the fascinating combination of economics, demography and its value system. Having possessed a third of the Earth’s landmass and almost two third of the world population, mostly young and energetic, Asia’s renaissance has become irresistible and irreversible.
I call it renaissance because Asia’s gain of supremacy is not a first time phenomenon. What we see today is rather the return of Asia to the glorious world podium of 200 years back. It’s a return to the time when Asia homed the world’s oldest and most affluent civilizations. Return to the time when it produced the world’s best artists and architect; best physics and metaphysics; most sophisticated education system and most enlightening writings on governance and statecraft.
When majority of the world was reeling in the darkness of superstition, this region, centuries back, produced Vedanta, the world’s most elaborate treatise of knowledge and wisdom as well as a most advanced philosophical system, and Buddhism, the most revered guiding principles on peace and nonviolence; and the notion of global fraternity and happiness.  Ancient Asia gave the world the advanced idea of town planning and sophisticated architecture. It also offered the idea of industry and techniques of trade.
Past 200 years were rather an aberration in Asia’s prominence. Reasons may vary, but the reality is that in the past 200 years, poverty and backwardness became most of Asia’s identity.
Today, Asia is already on the log march to success and prosperity. This journey may not be smooth and uninterrupted, but it is on.
Natural to its size, Asia is the most diverse region in the world. People are diverse and so are cultures; geography is diverse and so is the level of development. Amidst this, how do we ensure that Asia gradually evolves into a closer, connected and a better-integrated society?
How do we ensure that those lagging behind in development are offered a helping hand and a level playing field to keep up with the required pace? How do we ensure that we all, big and small, grow together as fellow Asian nations? How do we ensure that we sort out our differences or at least not allow such differences undermine the larger good that we need to pursue together? These turn out to be critical questions as we embark on the noble journey towards realization of the Asian century.
As important as the tangible indicators of development are, we need to make sure that the core Asian values of universal fraternity, peaceful co-existence, respect for diversity and sense of equality guide our ways as these are the values that stand as fortress to ensure world’s peace and security and sustainability of its development.
Asian values have the potential not only to bring us, the Asians, closer but also contribute to the world’s better future. These were born out of our collective, civilizational conviction on harmony, discipline and primacy of the larger public good and interest over petty individual self-centredness. Asian values emphasize more on sharing, caring and co-existing than on individual race making. Collective thinking and serving humanity is the Asian way.
Asian values underscore, as the fundamental prerequisite to development, the need to build solid and well-functioning state institutions.  While other actors are important components of modern day governance, state institutions must command due reverence and any ill-motivated attempt to undermine them must be discouraged.
Our collective journey towards realization of the Asian century can only be possible through due promotion and institutionalization of the Asian values.
Asia invented panchsheel that have not only become the core principles of the UN Charter but also provided the nations around the world the modus vivendi for living together peacefully despite differences and working together to serve mutual interest. Nepal’s adherence to panchsheel is unwavering.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Nepal’s engagement with the rest of the world, as stipulated in its Constitution, remains shaped by the principles of Panchasheel, non-alignment, UN Charter, international law, and norms of world peace.
Nepal was among the few countries that remained independent throughout its history. In this very fact of history is rooted the abounding sense of national pride of today’s 28 million Nepalis. We, therefore, hold dearer than anything else the principles of sovereignty, independence and non-interference.
We pursue an independent foreign policy and our conduct of external relations is based on a balanced outlook.
No one compromises on nationalism. For us, nationalism is the protection of our sovereignty, territorial integrity, national independence, and fulfilment of our national interest. We are a proud people of a country that always remained independent throughout its history. Our sense of nationalism does not harbour ill will against anyone. Our people have always demonstrated great degree of resilience in times of difficulties and their confidence was never shaken. Amity with all and enmity with none is our motto in foreign policy. We seek to foster relations with neighbours and all friendly countries around the world based on justice, sovereign equality, mutual respect and benefit.
Distinguished friends,
When it comes to Nepal-India relations, the enablers for cordial friendship and rewarding relations partnership are already there. We must build on those enablers to boost our relations. We must seize the opportunities to make our relations fruitful to the lives of our peoples. As close neighbours, we share a common destiny which demands collective pursuit of prosperity.
As I already said this afternoon, I have come to India this time with a mission to explore ways and means to enhance our relations to newer heights, commensurate with the realities of the 21st century. We want to erect a strong edifice of trust so that our relations always remain harmonious. We want to create a model relationship which makes not only us but our posterity equally proud of our accomplishment. A relationship that is cherished forever. Everybody has a role to contribute towards realizing this goal.
With this spirit in mind we have tasked the EPG-NIR to come forward with concrete recommendations on making Nepal-India relations truly beneficial for both of our countries and peoples. Our intention is genuine and larger Indian intelligentsia have a duty to spread the message of the need for a positive transformation in our relationship. I hope this gathering could serve this useful purpose.
During the visit, I had frank, open and comprehensive talks with Prime Minister Modiji. Our conversation was focused on the same direction. You are already aware of the important agreements we reached on railway and inland waterways connectivity as well as cooperation in agriculture.
I firmly believe, and hope you all would agree, a peaceful, stable, prosperous and democratic Nepal is in the interest of India as well as that of our larger neighbourhood.
Let me, therefore, conclude by reiterating my determination for closer and mutually rewarding relations between our two countries in this 21st century.
I thank you once again for such a wonderful opportunity.
I thank you all for your kind attention.

Closing Remarks by the Rt. Hon. Prime Minister at Business Interactive Roundtable, New Delhi, Friday, April 6, 2018
Posted onApril 6, 2018 


Dear captains of business and industries from Nepal and India.
Thank you for hosting this roundtable which is different from what I addressed last time.
I have carefully listened to you. Very important suggestions and comments have come from the floor. It has been really encouraging to get such valuable feedbacks.
CEO from Investment Board of Nepal made a comprehensive presentation. I will not repeat what he has said. But let me underline a few points that I deem important to share with you.
This is a commitment by a Prime Minister whose only aim is to bring about visible changes in the living standard of our people.

Nepal’s political transformation has been truly historic. We have institutionalized our political gains through a new constitution. Our next objective is economic transformation.  Our Motto is: Prosperous Nepal and Happy Nepalis.
We aspire to be middle income country by 2030 and graduate from LDC status at an early date.
We have a strong government at the centre that enjoys majority of three-fourth membership of the lower house. Stable Government means stability and continuity in policy regime.
Following the formation of the strong government, law and order situation has improved. This means Nepal is now safe for foreign investment. Any attempts to disturb law and order situation will be firmly dealt with.
We need massive investment in every sector. Nepal is considered a virgin land as far as investment is concerned. Investment in any sector is highly profitable. There is no competition for investment.
Indian investors have invested across the globe so why not to go to the next door Nepal? Geographical proximity, easy access, cultural similarities are all there to make you feel good about Nepal. Seize the opportunity!
Investors always look for markets. Look at Nepal’s position. For us, market is not a problem. Production is a problem. It is laying between the two vibrant economic powers of the world, India and China, that assure you of a promising market of over 2.5 billion populations. We enjoy duty free quota free market access in our neighbourhood. In addition, we enjoy duty free access to European market and preferential market into the USA for over 70 products as an LDC.
We are ready to listen to you. We want to know your views. We are committed to further improving business climate in the country. Reform is always desirable. We have enacted the laws and policies on foreign investment, Public-Private Partnership, industrial enterprises, banking and intellectual property. Come and talk to our authorities.
We are committed to liberal economic policy with private sector as a key partner. We have no intention to reverse the trends. Rest assured, we cannot go against the global trends.
Nepal has to offer attractive incentives. Compared to other countries, our incentive structure is quite attractive. We have reduced tariffs, simplified tax regimes and focused on the development & operation of trade related infrastructure.
We are planning to establish SEZ in major industrial centres of Nepal mostly in cities bordering India with incentives for industries including liberal labour law.
We have streamlined administrative procedures. Our bureaucracy is accessible and accountable. We are committed to provide corruption- free administration. We are pursuing policy of zero tolerance on corruption. Good governance and rule of law are at the core of our governance system.
We have stablished a high-powered investment board headed by prime minister that brings together government and private sector. It is facilitating the big investors by providing all services from single window.
There is a favourable fiscal environment: we have low tax slabs, no income tax on dividends and export earnings, exemption of tax and tax holidays for certain industries, exemption of duty and fees on the key inputs used by an export Industry.
Our law permit full repatriation of income earned from investment and reinvestment.
Foreign Companies registered in Nepal can purchase, own and sell land.
No discrimination between national and foreign investors. No nationalization of private industry. Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement has been signed with India.  We are discussing the new version of bilateral investment agreement.
The other factor that makes you competitive in Nepal is availability of cheaper labour force. Since we are not taking about high-tech industries at this point of time, our labour force will be an added asset for any business enterprise.  We have reformed labour law and industrial relations have improved.
Infrastructure is key to economic development. Top priority of Government is cross border infrastructures for better connectivity. Modern ICP at Birgunj is operating soon. ICPs at 3 other places are being built and Railway connectivity is being established at 5 border points.
Bilateral motor vehicle agreement has been signed and operationalized which facilitates the movement of people across the border.
Almost every sectors including manufacturing, hydropower, IT, mining and agro based industries are opened for foreign investment. It is quite a liberal regime.
Power Trade Agreement with India has been signed. Nepal India both can benefit from utilization of hydropower resources. Cross border transmission lines are operational and we are going to build new transmission lines.
Tourism is an attractive sector. There are many things that Nepal can offer.  It is a tourist paradise. Combination of nature and culture makes Nepal a destination throughout the year. Nepal is an idle place for Indian tourists. Building tourism infrastructure is our priority. Regional airports are being developed in Pokhara and Lumbini.
Agriculture and herbal processing are yet other areas in which investment can be profitable.
IBN is facilitating the big Indian investments in Arun-3 and Upper Karnali. We were able to receive a pledge of 14 billion dollars in Investment Summit organized in Kathmandu last year.

5 April 2018, Baku, Azerbaijan
Theme: “Promoting international peace and security for sustainable development”
Mr. Chairman,
Honourable Ministers,
Excellencies,
Distinguished Delegates,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I have brought with me warm greetings and best wishes from the people and Government of Nepal to the friendly people and the Government of Azerbaijan and to all delegations.
At the outset, I congratulate to you, Mr. Chairman, on your unanimous election to the chair of this meeting and pledge my delegations’ full support.
My delegation admires the excellent arrangements made for this meeting and appreciates the warm hospitality extended to us in this beautiful city of Baku.
I also wish to put on record our gratitude to the leadership of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela as the Chair of our Movement.
Mr. Chairman,
The Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) was born out of our collective desire for universal peace, unity, shared prosperity, fair international order, and balanced multi-polarity. As a founding member of NAM, its principles remain the guiding ethos of our foreign policy. Our commitment to NAM stands firm and unequivocal. In the face of global challenges, non-alignment as a principle continues to be relevant to guide international relations.
Mr. Chairman,
The race for armament, conflicts, civil wars, poverty, famines, and disregard of international law endanger international peace and security. The hunger and poverty continue to degrade human dignity. It is ironic that in the midst of unprecedented economic growth, millions of people still live in abject poverty, disease and deprivation.  Whereas the military expenditure in the world exceeds 3.5 billion dollars every day, not even 7 billion dollars annually is available for 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Attaining sustainable development goals becomes daunting in such an environment.
Mr. Chairman,
Peace, security and sustainable development are mutually reinforcing. Nepal’s own experience confirms that exclusion is a major breeding cause for conflict; and lack of peace and security can reverse development gains. Upholding values of democracy, inclusive governance, participatory development, human rights and rule of law are critical elements to ensure sustainable development as well as peace and security. Most of the countries suffering from conflicts and under-development are members of our Movement. Regrettably, the cumulative human, social and opportunity costs exacted due to the conflicts nowhere match the resources that we have spent for peace and development.
Mr. Chairman,
It falls on us to exert all our power for the prevention and resolution of conflicts, and help attain sustainable development. Our Movement can do a great deal in this regard. Just to mention a few,

The success of one member in averting conflict and promoting sustainable development can be emulated by other members with similar socio-cultural and economic conditions. The NAM members, in a spirit of solidarity, should support each other by sharing their experiences, best practices and resources through South-South Cooperation. Nepal is ready to share its experience of uniquely successful peace process.
It is also equally important to strengthen multilateralism by upholding and defending the principles of UN Charter and international law. Nepal believes that sovereignty, sovereign equality, territorial integrity and non-interference in the internal affairs of any State are the cardinal values of multilateral system. They are indispensable for maintaining international peace and security as well as for achieving SDGs. NAM members should work together to make UN a strong, transparent and democratic institution through necessary reforms of its structures and processes.
NAM should further strengthen its solidarity, and build internal cohesion and synergy. NAM’s common vision for peace, security and sustainable development should be well articulated for being heard and respected in the multilateral system. International rule of law counts supreme in this respect.
The poor and vulnerable countries are marginalized in global economy. They bear the brunt of adverse impact of the financial and economic crises, and are left out from the benefits of international systems. Therefore, the international financial system should be democratized to make it more open, transparent and equitable for increased voice and representation of the landlocked, least developed and other vulnerable countries. It should ensure adequate mobilization of financial resources for growth and development of these countries.
Trade and investment are critical for ensuring inclusive and sustainable development. The international trade and investment regimes should be open, equitable, rule-based, predictable and non-discriminatory and should benefit the countries in special situation. To realize this, NAM must work closely with the Group of 77 through the existing Joint Coordinating Committee.

Mr. Chairman,
Turning to my own country, I have the pleasure to share this august session that having gone through a decade long armed conflict, Nepal now presents a uniquely successful case of home grown peace process. Our experience confirms that peace building in post-conflict society can be successful through honest dialogues, mutual respect, willingness to implement the agreements, and inclusive political process. A milestone in this process has been recently achieved. After the promulgation of the most progressive and democratic constitution in 2015, we successfully concluded democratic elections at all three tiers of federal structure in 2017. The elections ensured participation of all sections of our society with over 41 percent of women’s representation. With political stability firmly set, the government remains squarely focused on attaining economic development with social justice.
To conclude, Mr. Chairman, as guided by the NAM principles, ‘amity with all, and enmity with none’ has remained the hallmark of Nepal’s foreign policy.  Nepal will continue to play active and positive role to promote this value in international relations. We will constructively engage with our friends to advance the cause of international peace, security and development. I urge you all to unite our strengths to ensure peace and security in the world, leave no one behind in the development process, and help achieving sustainable development.
I thank you.

Remarks by the Prime Minister Right Honourable Mr. K.P. Sharma Oli at the Luncheon Hosted for Diplomatic Community, Baluwatar, Kathmandu.
27 March 2018
Honourable Ministers
Honourable Former Prime Ministers,
Excellencies, Ambassadors and Heads of diplomatic Missions
Dear Colleagues,
I am pleased to welcome you all to this Luncheon at my official residence today. Thank you for accepting our invitation. I have met most of you individually. But we are meeting in this format for the first time since I assumed the office of the Prime Minister recently.
Please allow me to briefly share with you my views on three topics. First, I will speak about Nepal’s recent political developments. Then, I will highlight the major priorities of the present government. And, finally, I will touch upon our foreign policy priorities.
As you all know, Nepal has undergone transformation of historic proportions in the past one decade. The impact of transformation has not only confined to political sphere but also has been felt across all spheres of national life. The transformation has been monumental in our political and constitutional history.
The most important phase of political transformation of Nepal began in September 2015 when we promulgated a highly progressive and democratic constitution through a popularly elected Constituent Assembly. You all are witness to this. I don’t think we need further elaboration. I must say that this was a culmination of our successful, long and arduous struggles and Nepal’s ‘unique and home-grown’ peace process. The constitution has institutionalized federal democratic republican system of governance, embodying the political gains achieved over the years through successive people’s struggles and revolutions.
The next important milestone was achieved when we successfully concluded federal, provincial and local level elections in 2017. All of you have personally witnessed this. The elections, which were held in a free, fair and impartial manner, saw high turnout of the voters. We have accomplished this historic responsibility to implement the constitution. I am happy to share with you that we have been able to ensure over 41 per cent of women representation in elected bodies. This is not a small achievement by any standard. We will make further efforts to bridge the gap of remaining 9 per cent.
With all elections completed, the federal system of governance has been fully functional. Governments have been formed at all three levels of the federal structure. Finally, we have entered into an era of political stability. We have paid heavy price to reach this stage.  Thank you for your moral support in our struggle for democracy. We believe that our friends and well-wishers who want to see a peaceful, stable and prosperous Nepal also cherish this historic achievement of the people of Nepal.
At the federal level, we are now poised to have a stable government with more than 3/4th majority support of the House. All provincial governments enjoy above 2/3rd majority support of the assemblies. We are now supporting the governments at provincial levels in creating necessary condition for them to function smoothly. Likewise, we are supporting 753 governments at local level. Enhancing their capacity and making them more effective and resourceful is a need of the hour.
These political achievements must be augmented with socio-economic progress. There is indeed a need and a historic opportunity for us to move forward the agenda of peace, good governance, development and prosperity.
We have realized that our efforts must therefore be on turning a page towards peace, stability and development with social justice. We know the cost of inaction will be colossal. Every second of our time is precious and wastage of it is no longer an option. We cannot take resort to any excuse should we fail to deliver. Hence, there is no option for us but to succeed.
The Government, under my leadership, is formed against this backdrop. So, it is very much incumbent upon the present government to take on the generational challenge of socio-economic progress. And, we are fully committed to transforming this legitimate aspiration of our people into reality.
Please let me now touch upon some of the major policies and priorities of this government:
The present government has the motto of ‘Prosperous Nepal and happy Nepali.’ Its policies and programmes will be founded on six fundamental pillars.
The first one is nationalism. I understand nationalism as the protection of our sovereignty, territorial integrity, national independence, and fulfilment of our national interest. We, the Nepalis, are a proud people with our long and glorious history of independence and sovereignty. We are committed to safeguarding that space for the benefit of our national interest and for the good of our posterity. Pursuit of National interest and fulfillment of international obligations must go hand in hand. This comes as a non-negotiable priority for us. We will serve this cause on the basis of our values, realities, and aspirations.
Second, our commitment to democracy and fundamental freedoms is total and unflinching. The long journey of our political struggle is synonymous to the struggle for democracy. Our constitution has incorporated all the universally accepted norms and values which are eloquently manifested in the bill of rights enshrined in it.  We believe that democracy is irreversible and no one can snatch it now from us.  No one would dare to dismantle the solid foundation of democracy we have so thoughtfully built. We hold this very dear and will not allow any compromise on democratic norms, values and principles.
Third, we cannot imagine sustainable peace and prosperity without social justice based on equality. We stand firm on achieving social justice that ensures equitable opportunities and equal protection to all sections of our society.  Ours is a society full of diversity. Unity in diversity has been a Nepali characteristic and a primary source of our strength.  Our constitution prohibits discrimination on any ground and the State is obliged to safeguard this fundamental right. Inclusive polity, which  has been the true spirit of our constitution, has been influenced by our culture and tradition.  And, we want to implement it in earnest.
Fourth and one of the most important ones will be stability, progress and development. We will continue to strive for progressive changes in our political, economic and socio-cultural set up. We have learnt hard lessons from our own experiences what the price of instability would be. Any attempt to undermine peace and stability will not be tolerated at any cost and will be dealt with firmly and resolutely. There is no space for violence in our society.
Sovereignty lies in people and our constitution has guaranteed it. Sovereign people of Nepal are free to take decision on matter affecting their life. Peaceful pursuit of political objectives must therefore remain at the core of our political discourse. However, we must remain cautious and vigilant to preserve our political gains. There might be some attempts from different quarters to disrupt our social harmony and cohesion under various pretexts. There might be some elements who believe in perpetuity of conflict and discord in our society. We do not want to see our people exploited under any ulterior agenda. We will stand united and pull our resources together to defeat the forces of divisions and instability and work for the betterment of our people who deserve a decent life.  Only the people of Nepal have the sovereign right to decide on constitutional, political and all other issues affecting them.
Fifth, our commitment to good governance is strong and we want to make it a reality in our life. It will continue to guide the policies, programmes and activities of the government. Rule of law will be at the center of governance and will be pursued in an effective manner. We will also pursue a policy of zero-tolerance against corruption. Our aim is to ensure corruption-free governance. We will adopt efficient and smart mode of service delivery so that people can feel the change.  Transparency and accountability will be effectively enforced. Beyond national efforts, I just want to emphasize that good governance must be pursued at all levels, from national to international.  We all have to move from rhetoric to reality.
Sixth, with an end of the protracted political transition, the exclusive focus of the government now will be to fulfil people’s aspirations for broad based, inclusive and sustainable development. We have a strong resolve to attain rapid economic growth to underpin political transformation. We want to overcome the vicious circle of poverty, underdevelopment and social backwardness. Our resource-rich country can no longer afford to be poor. We must firmly and decisively attack on poverty, hunger and backwardness.
Centered on these pillars, we will build greater convergence on national development agenda among the government, political parties, private sector, and civil society.
Our development challenges are manifold and daunting. We still are in the bottom rung of the development ladder. Overcoming these challenges would not be possible with the limited capacity and resources at the disposal of the government. We therefore invite the private sector, both domestic and foreign, to invest and contribute to production and employment generation.
We are fully committed to strengthening business and investment environment. In order to improve and facilitate trade and investment, we have reduced tariffs, simplified tax regimes and focused on the development and operation of trade related infrastructure.
We are committed to graduating from the LDC category at the earliest. We need to achieve a double-digit growth to make it happen. Promotion of trade and investment is, therefore, a natural priority of the government. All political parties are united to ensure investment-friendly environment in the country. Hydropower, tourism, agriculture, infrastructure development and IT are some of the areas in which we need massive investment. These areas have the potential to transform our developmental landscape.
Advanced, modern and efficient technology is the key to promote knowledge-based economy that is the base of sustainable development. Prosperity through the overall development as well as the utmost use of science and technology in all sectors is our mission.
Nepal has huge demographic dividends. Job creation is our top priority. We want to retain our youths and engage them in economic activities.
Post- earthquakes reconstruction of the damaged structures, buildings and cultural as well as historical sites will receive our priority.
Now I will highlight briefly the present government’s foreign policy priorities.
We live in a world that is full of contradictions and uncertainties. Forces of both stability and disruption are active. Adjustment to a rapidly changing world is a major challenge for everyone and more so for a country like ours. Stability in the global order is essential for peace, development and democracy around the world.
Nepal’s constitution has defined national interests and provided a framework to conduct our international relations.
Promoting the image of Nepal at the international level as a State that is practicing comprehensive democracy as well as advancing the cause of Nepal’s socio-economic development will remain our two intrinsic diplomatic goals.
With this direction firmly set on future, we will continue to be guided by some fundamental premises.
First and foremost, the promotion of Nepal’s national interest while maintaining sovereignty, territorial integrity, and independence of the country. As the people of a country that was never under the control of any external power, we hold, more than anything else, the principles of sovereignty, independence and non-interference close to our heart.  Independent foreign policy and balanced conduct of relations will be the hallmarks of our external engagements.
Second, our overall engagements will be directed, as always, by the principles of Panchasheel, non-alignment, UN Charter, international law, and norms of world peace. Our efforts will be towards promoting a just and equitable international order in which all States- small and big- fulfil their international obligations in good faith, and all countries enjoy equitable opportunities to fulfil aspirations for development and prosperity.
Third, our motto will be ‘amity with all, and enmity with none’.  We want to be a good friend of everyone and we want to treat everyone as a good friend. We believe that this helps foster trust and understanding. We will pursue international relations based on justice, sovereign equality, mutual respect and benefit.
Fourth, development imperatives at home will be the guideposts for our diplomatic engagements abroad. Focused pursuit of economic development agenda at the international level will remain a key priority. We believe that development and prosperity are universal goals and all nations have legitimate interest in achieving them. We must therefore recognize the development space for everyone. Development must not be seen through the optics of geopolitics.
Fifth, our culture, civilization and identity are our assets. Building Nepal’s image as the land of diverse and bountiful resources will be our goal.
Our diplomatic machinery will be mobilized in line with these premises. Let me now talk about some of the key areas of our priorities.
On neighbourhood: we enjoy cordial and friendly relation with both our immediate neighbours, India and China. Mutual trust will be the key ingredient of our relationship. We are thankful for all the goodwill and support of our neighbours towards our national aspirations. We look forward to further strengthening these relations at all levels of our cooperation. Serving our national interest and fulfilling our legitimate aspiration of economic development and prosperity will guide our engagements.  In particular, we will remain engaged in the ‘vibrant economic drive’ of the neighbourhood with a view to benefitting from it. We respect the legitimate interests of our neighbours and will not allow anything against them in our soil.
We also wish to enhance our relations with all other friendly countries in our extended neighbourhood. Our engagements will be based on mutual respect and cooperation. We want to explore, open up and diversify our relations especially in the areas of trade, investment, tourism and people-to-people exchanges.
We would be working towards enriching the substance of cooperation in our bilateral engagements with major powers and development partners. We fully acknowledge the support and cooperation received from our development partners. Given the level of our development, we still need an enhanced level of development cooperation from our partners mainly for economic development. We urge the development partners to align assistance with our priorities, respecting our leadership and ownership in the process and channelizing such support through government mechanisms. We must create a success story of development cooperation. Fragmentation of precious resources and use of multiple channels will not yield desired results.
We will closely work with labour-receiving countries for safety, security and wellbeing of our migrant workers. We would like to expand the scope of cooperation with these countries beyond labour issues to encompass trade, investment and tourism.
Our multilateral engagements including at the UN will be made more effective. We know that we all, as a global community, share global challenges.  These challenges can only be addressed by an inclusive and rule-based international system. We support the UN reform initiatives to provide equal emphasis on all three pillars- peace and security, development and human rights, and to make the world body more efficient, effective and responsive of the need of our time. On our part, Nepal will continue contributing to the maintenance of international peace and security through its effective participation in UN mandated peacekeeping operations.
We favour peaceful solution of international disputes. We support the national leadership and ownership of any solution to crisis situations and apolitical role of the agencies like the United Nations. Nepal will continue to lend support in favour of total and complete disarmament, especially of all weapons of mass destruction. Nepal will also lend support to global efforts to fight against terrorism. Nepal condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and believes that terrorist acts cannot be justified on any ground.
Nepal will remain constructively engaged to advance the cause of global peace, security and development.  Solidarity and cooperation with LDCs, LLDCs and SIDS will continue to characterize our deliberations. We call for effective implementation of all relevant international instruments to address the specific development needs of these countries in special situation.
We have owned and integrated the SDGs into our national policies and programmes. And, we aspire to achieve them well before the deadline. We urge the international community to faithfully and effectively implement the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. Special vulnerabilities of countries like ours must be taken into consideration while taking decision on climate change related funds and support measures.
Nepal has been elected as a member of the Human Rights Council for the term of 2018-20. We remain grateful to all those UN member States that supported our candidature. As a member, we will provide a strong voice to all those around the globe who look up to the Council to make a positive difference in their lives. Nepal will always stand for apolitical and objective examination of human rights issues. We consider that by attaining economic development and providing means of implementation of human rights obligations create enabling environment for the enjoyment of human rights by all.
To fully address the issue of transitional justice, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons are currently engaged in the country. I reiterate that there should be no blanket amnesty to serious violations of human rights and humanitarian laws. We are serious to ensure that the process is fair and free from pressure and influences -both from within and outside the country.
Promoting regional economic cooperation remains a priority in our foreign policy. We will continue to closely working together with fellow Member States of SAARC and BIMSTEC to accelerate these regional processes for achieving regional peace, progress and prosperity. We will play an active role in Asian Cooperation Dialogue (ACD) and Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO).
The mainstay of today’s diplomacy is the pursuit of economic agenda. Therefore, we will strive to promote our vital economic interests at the international level. This will be done through activities aimed at attracting more foreign investment in our national priority sectors, expanding our export trade and promoting tourism, among others.
We will be more than happy to receive high level dignitaries from our neighbours and all other friendly countries. I am hopeful that our friends will give a serious thought to it. We would like to share our experiences and achievements of our unique peace process as well as political transformation with our friends through exchange of high-level visits.
To conclude, we are aware that the goal of stability and progress cannot be achieved with the efforts of the Government alone. At home, it is a collective responsibility of the government, private sector, civil society and all other stakeholders. Enhanced support and cooperation of the international development partners will also be equally important. I request all of you and- through you- the governments and institutions you represent to contribute to our mission.
I thank you all for your attention.

Statement by H.E. Mr. Shanker Das Bairagi, Foreign Secretary and Head of Nepali delegation to the High-level Segment of the 37th Session of Human Rights Council
Posted onFebruary 26, 2018 

Geneva, 26 February 2018

Madam Chair,
Excellencies,
Distinguished delegates,
Ladies and Gentlemen.
I feel honoured to address this august session of the Human Rights Council.
I congratulate the President and other members of the bureau on their election and assure them of Nepal’s full support in fulfilling their responsibility. Let me also express sincere thanks to the High Commissioner for Human Rights for his contribution to the cause of human rights.
As Nepal is addressing the Council for the first time as its Member, let me begin by extending our sincere thanks and gratitude to all UN Member States for reposing trust on Nepal and electing us to the Council last October. We will constructively engage with all the Member and Observer States of the Council to deliver on its mandates.
The Prime Minister of Nepal has sent warm felicitations on behalf of the people and Government of Nepal for the success of the Council.
Madam Chair,
This year marks the 70th year of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and 25th year of the Vienna Declaration and Program of Action.
Both these landmark events constantly remind us of the non-politicization and non-selectivity as all human rights are universal, indivisible, interrelated, interdependent and mutually reinforcing.
All human rights merit to be treated globally in a fair and equal manner on the same footing and with the same emphasis.
Nepal firmly upholds these values as guiding light in its efforts to the protection and promotion of human rights.
 
Madam Chair,
For many developing countries like Nepal, the right to development bears a profound meaning. We firmly hold that democracy, development and respect for human rights are interdependent and mutually reinforcing. They must remain balanced and operational at national, regional and international levels. The rule of law must work at all levels.
As we celebrate the silver jubilee of the Vienna Declaration, its promise to realize the universal and inalienable right to development still remains unfulfilled.
Faithful implementation of the Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development and other relevant internationally agreed development frameworks through enhanced partnership and collaboration is central to the protection of human rights everywhere.
 
Madam Chair,
The Human Rights Council has been playing an important role for the protection and promotion of human rights by all.
The Universal Periodic Review mechanism has successfully evolved to become a hallmark of positive international cooperation in the realm of human rights.
We consider that the collaborative and constructive approach embraced by the UPR process should be further promoted. Such approach promotes transparency and fairness, in view of the fact that no single country has ever achieved perfections in human rights.
Nepal has remained constructively engaged with the UN Human Rights mechanisms. Two years ago, we had undergone second cycle of review under the UPR. Its recommendations are now being implemented in earnest under a well-defined action plan.
Nepal’s initial report under the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities was considered last week.
Nepal’s periodic reports under the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women are scheduled for consideration later this year.
This month we hosted Special Rapporteur on the Human Rights of Migrants, Mr. Felipe Gonzalez Morales.
We have also extended invitations to the Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food and the Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women, its Causes and Consequences for a country visit to Nepal. We look forward to welcoming them soon.
 
Madam Chair, 
Nepal represents a unique case study of a successful peace process from an armed conflict into a democratic political transformation that began in 2006. At the heart of this entire process lies the aspiration and strong national commitment to ensure equal rights to all of our people.
Nepal’s commitment to the universal values of human rights is total. We are a party to all major international human rights instruments, including seven of the nine core human rights conventions. We have abolished death penalty and do not condone impunity.  Rule of law remains at the centre of our constitutional and legal process.
Human rights form a fundamental pillar of the Constitution of Nepal promulgated through the popularly elected Constituent Assembly in September 2015. The Constitution consolidates inclusive democratic polity, pluralism, the rule of law, representative and accountable government, social and economic justice, and universally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms.
We have adopted federal system of governance to manage the diversity of Nepal. Through 2017, Nepal conducted a series of elections for local level, provincial assemblies and federal parliament. With successful conclusion of these elections and formation of Government in each tier of federal structure our constitution has come into full implementation. This is a significant milestone crossed in Nepal’s journey to federal democratic order.
Besides ensuring the successful completion of the peace process and democratic transition, the elections have brought a transformative effect in the empowerment of women, indigenous people, Dalits, Madheshis, persons with disabilities, among others. They are now at the forefront of political and development process.
Women now represent 33 per cent at the federal and provincial assemblies. At the local level the figure is much higher well beyond the constitutionally guaranteed 40 per cent.
Similarly, 45% of the public sector employment have been reserved for weaker section of our population. The policy of affirmative action has significantly enhanced access to education, health services, employment opportunities and political participation.
Nepal has introduced rights-based approach to development, and adheres to policy of zero-tolerance against gender-based violence.
Madam Chair,
Strengthening of national capacity remains our priority. The National Human Rights Commission and other independent constitutional commissions dedicated to women, Madheshi, Tharu, Muslim and indigenous people are being further consolidated.
The National Human Rights Commission of Nepal conforms to the Paris principles and has consistently been accredited with ‘A’ status.
We have vibrant media that play an important supportive role in promotion and protection of human rights wider and deeper in society.
Civil society organizations are recognized as partners in development, and many of them play the role of human rights defenders.
Nepal’s judiciary is independent and competent to uphold and safeguard human rights and fundamental freedoms. The Supreme Court has given landmark judgements, which have expanded scope of human rights jurisprudence and added dimensions in inclusive realization of human rights.
 
Madam Chair,
To fully address the issue of transitional justice, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons are currently engaged in the country. Terms of the Commissions have recently been extended, for a second time, for completion of their mandates. This will allow the investigation and prosecution of all allegations of serious violations of human rights and humanitarian laws, and to ensure justice and accountability.
To conclude, Madam Chair, Nepal truly believes that together we can provide a strong voice to all those around the globe who look up to the Council to make a positive difference in their lives by upholding the mantle of human rights. For that the Council must be apolitical and objective and should examine human rights issues on merit basis in a spirit of openness and dialogue.
I thank you.

Posted onNovember 3, 2017 

Address by H.E. Mrs. Ambika Devi Luintel, Head of Nepali Delegation to the 39th Session of the General Conference of the UNESCO 
on Thursday, 2nd November 2017

Excellencies;
Madame President of the General Conference;
Madame Director General;
Distinguished Delegates,
Ladies and Gentlemen.

I express my sincere thanks to Director General, Madam Irina Bokova, for the excellent arrangement of the thirty-ninth General Conference of UNESCO. I convey the best wishes of the Government and the people of Nepal for its success.
UNESCO is uniquely placed in matters pertaining to education as its mandate covers all facets of education including science, culture, social science, information and communications.  While appreciating the UNESCO’s contributions to member states in these areas we would like to see the continuity of UNESCO’s enhanced role specifically in developing world. At the same time, I reaffirm Nepal’s firm commitment to the ideals of UNESCO, and its enhanced role and activities.
Madam Chair
We recognise the importance of  Man and Biosphere (MaB) and International Hydrological Program (IHP)  of the UNESCO. In this context, it would be relevant to mention that International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development. (ICIMOD), established in 1983 under the MaB programme following UNESCO’s Regional Meeting in Kathmandu in 1979, has been working in environmental conservation of Hindu Kush Himalyas.  I am pleased to bring to your notice that the MaB Committee in Nepal has recently initiated activities to design the first Biosphere Reserve in the country for advocacy and to raise awareness about scientific, environmental, social and development issues in the Himalayan ecosystems.
As we are all aware that the consequences of global warming have been adversely affecting the mountain regions. Melting of ice in the Himalayas may cause Glacial Lake Outburst Flood resulting in widespread damage to the biodiversity not only to Nepal but also to the entire South Asian Region. This  issue thus demands the need of appropriate programmes with added urgency including measures like MaB, IHP and sustainable use of natural resources where UNESCO can play a pivotal role.
The IHP-Nepal, in coordination with UNESCO IHP and other related agencies in Nepal, is aiming at participating in river basin planning and Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) training as a part of IHP VIII  “Water education”. Furthermore, the IHP-Nepal intends to establish a UNESCO category II Center, “Knowledge Centre on Water Resources and Climate Changes Adaptation” in Nepal with the support of UNESCO. Since, the rivers  play an important role in the livelihood of  humankind,  we would like to see UNESCO taking an initiation for a dedicated inter-sectoral program to link “life and rivers” and the implementation of water programs of UNESCO as a separate Main Line of Actions.
Madam President,
Nepal recognizes education as the very foundation to further and promote the universal values of compassion, tolerance, mutual respect, inclusion and sustainable development including gender and climate change. In addition, the Constitution of Nepal establishes education as one of the fundamental rights: free and compulsory basic education, free secondary education and free higher education for the targeted group.
Over the years, Education Sector in Nepal has made significant progress  in terms of human development indicators including  gender parity and cycle completion. Focus has also been given to ICT while designing curriculum, teachers’ training and provisions of computers to schools. Technical and Vocational Education has also been introduced in the secondary education. Government recognizes the importance of Lifelong learning and non-formal education as an important tool for developing human capital.
In spite of these achievements, Nepal has still a long way to go in terms of equity, quality and efficiency.  Ensuring education for out-of-school children, the construction of school buildings damaged by 2015 earthquake, development of skills for life and work for all age groups  and resource constraint are some other challenges. We urge UNESCO to enhance its contribution to address these challenges for the effective implementation of SDG in order to  ensure that no child is deprived of education and other basic human rights.
With the completion of Millennium Development Goals (MDG), the implementation of Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) is on the way with a view to graduating Nepal to middle income country by 2030. Under the framework of Incheon Declaration of the World Education Forum 2015, School Sector Development Plan (SSDP) is being carried out as a successor to the Education for All in Nepal.
Distinguished Delegates,
The promulgation of the Constitution of Nepal in September 2015 marks the culmination of the long and arduous efforts and sacrifices of Nepali people over a period of seven decades. The new constitution guarantees liberty and fundamental freedoms of Nepali people and ensures gender equality, justice, progress and prosperity  for  all
As per the provision enshrined in the Constitution, various policies have focused on media ethics, security and capacity building of the journalists, among others. This shows our commitment to ensure the safety of journalists with appropriate measures.
For the first time in our political history, Nepal has entered in federal republic set up. Under this, we recently completed the local level elections, in which an overwhelming majority of Nepali people exercised their voting rights.  Similarly, provincial and federal level elections are going to be held in November and December this year. Thus, with the implementation of the Constitution, democracy will be institutionalized which would pave the way for achieving  economic growth, sustainable peace  and development.
Madam President,
 Recent years have witnessed significant increase in the destruction of cultural heritage worldwide, either due to natural disasters or deliberately through barbaric attacks of violent extremism. In this regard, UNESCO’s role for conservation and protection of these assets including those in Nepal is commendable. In this context, I would like to inform that the Government of Nepal has taken concrete steps towards post-earthquake conservation, reconstruction and rehabilitation of World Heritage sites, especially the Kathmandu Valley, in line with the six-year Recovery Master Plan and post–earthquake conservation guidelines 2015.
Finally, I take this opportunity to express our sincere gratitude to Madame Irina Bukova for her effective stewardship of UNESCO during her tenure and her support to Nepal. I wish all the best for her future endeavors.
Thank you for your attention!

Statement delivered by the Rt. Hon. Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba at the 72nd UNGA
Posted onSeptember 23, 2017 

Statement by The Right Honorable Sher Bahadur Deuba, Prime Minister and the Leader of Nepali Delegation to the 72nd Session of United Nations General Assembly
New York, 23 September 2017
 
Mr. President, 
I bring warm greetings from the people and Government of Nepal, the land of Lord Buddha and Mount Everest, to the delegates and best wishes for the success of this session.
I congratulate you, Mr. President, on your election to the presidency of the seventy-second session of the UN General Assembly. I pledge full support in the discharge of your important responsibilities.
I also wish to place on record our appreciation to your predecessor, Ambassador Peter Thompson of Fiji, for his sterling leadership.
I warmly congratulate His Excellency Antonio Guterres, on his appointment as the Secretary General of the United Nations. With his experience, vision and versatility across a wide range of areas, we are assured of his wise leadership of the organization in this challenging time. We extend best wishes and full support to him, including on his reform efforts to make our organization fit-for-purpose.
I also commend his predecessor Ban-ki Moon for his dynamic leadership of the organization.
Mr. President, 
It has been almost two decades since I first addressed from this podium.
In decades that followed, the world has witnessed profound transformation. While there are some notable achievements in poverty reduction, school enrollment, gender equality and combatting communicable diseases, it is not without multiple and complex challenges.
The world has become more inter-dependent, and better connected. Growing interdependence and pluralism have unleashed both challenges and opportunities.
A big geopolitical transformation is in the making.
The rise of inward looking tendency in some of the nation-states marked by the tide of populism on both the left and the right have created confusion over the course of world politics.
Global community faces a more complex and polarized environment with multiple transnational challenges ranging from terrorism, climate change, energy deficiency, food insecurity, and mass migration to extremism.
Ethnic tensions and intra-state conflicts have taken toll on millions of innocent lives. The sufferings of people in Syria, Iraq, Libya and Yemen have not abated.
Unfortunately, our efforts have been too little, and often too late.
All these challenges reinforce the role and responsibility of the United Nations.
Mr. President,
As we embark upon a path of implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, such challenges are the litmus tests for our leadership.
The choice of the theme for our deliberations at this Assembly “Focusing on people: striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planet” provides a clear direction ahead.
Path to peace and decent life for all will remain elusive without resources and commitment for the implementation of Sustainable Development Goals. A very small fraction of trillions of dollars spent in armament can help the countries in need to attain these goals.
Delivery on commitments, inclusive process, coordinated efforts and shared responsibilities backed by adequate resources are essential to secure sustainable future and ensure that no one is left behind.
After years of political transition, Nepal now seeks to project a clear roadmap to prosperity. Aligned with economic, social and environmental pillars of the SDGs, Nepal’s development priorities will be framed around the imperative of generating, sharing and sustaining broad-based prosperity.
Mr. President, 
The vicious race for weapons of mass destruction continues to threaten the world.
Nepal calls for a time-bound, general and complete disarmament.
Nepal welcomes the confidence-building measures on conventional weapons, ending nearly two decades of stalemate in the UN Disarmament Commission.
Nepal has signed the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons as a step towards nuclear disarmament.
Nepal deplores the continued defiance by DPRK of the repeated calls of the UN Security Council and the international community.  We urge DPRK to abide by all the relevant resolutions of the UN Security Council. We believe this alone safeguards peace and promotes stability on the Korean Peninsula.
As the host to the Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament for the Asia-Pacific, Nepal underlines the   need to reactivate the regional disarmament deliberations under the Kathmandu Process.
Mr. President,
Violent extremism and religious fundamentalism have undermined peace and security in different parts of the world – with more youths being radicalized, with more lives being devastated, societies turning intolerant.
Terrorism is a curse to humanity and biggest threat to democracy and development.
Nepal condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, and anywhere in the world.
The world must come together to address not just its symptoms but the root causes.  Early conclusion of the anti-terrorism global convention is the call of our time.
Mr. President,
Successful peacekeeping demands objectivity, impartiality and ability of the Mission to deliver with the consent and confidence of the host governments.
Having contributed over a hundred and thirty thousand peacekeepers in some of the most challenging theatres and true to our commitment to the success of UN peace operations, Nepal remains prepared to provide additional troops and civilians for this noble cause.
While we welcome the new standards and assessment mechanisms, a sustained partnership for capability building of peacekeepers is crucial for improving performance in peace operations. The UN should play a supportive role in capacity building of peace keeping related institutions.
Nepal has been a host to a world class peace-keeping training center- the oldest one in the region. The United Nations can make the best use of this facility and help develop it as a regional centre of excellence for peacekeeping training.
Nepal firmly believes that all troop and police contributing countries must get fair opportunities to serve in leadership positions both in the field and at the headquarters commensurate with their level and length of contribution.
Protection of civilians should be at the center of peacekeeping operations. Nepal believes the safety and security of the peacekeepers is the key to enhance their ability to deliver from the high moral ground.
On sexual exploitation and abuse, we must move from zero tolerance to zero case scenario. It is in this spirit that Nepal endorsed the Kigali Principles in its entirety, and signed the Secretary-General’s Voluntary Compact on the Elimination of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse.
Mr. President,
All human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated and should be accorded equal emphasis including the right to development.
The constitution of Nepal accommodates aspirations of all of its citizens. It guarantees a comprehensive set of internationally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms.
We are fully committed to the promotion and protection of those rights and their full enjoyment by our people.
The constitution establishes powerful commissions to promote and protect rights and interests specific to women, Dalits, Muslims, Madhesis, indigenous people  and other disadvantaged  communities.
The National Human Rights Commission, an independent constitutional body, is responsible for overall monitoring of the human rights situation and investigation into the cases of their violation.
Nepal views the right to life as the most important of all human rights. Nepal’s constitution bans death penalty in all circumstances. As a party to 24 international human rights instruments, including 7 out of 9 core instruments, Nepal  has been fulfilling its international obligations with all sincerity, and to the best of its ability.
Against this backdrop, Nepal has presented its candidature to the UN Human Rights Council for the term 2018-2020.
Nepal’s first-ever election to the Council would be the recognition of our long commitment and contributions in the field of human rights and an encouragement to do more at national as well as global levels.  We seek invaluable support of all Member States to Nepal’s candidature.
Mr. President,
Migration is a mega-trend.
Ensuring safe, orderly and regular migration is the need of our time. Nepal eagerly looks forward to a successful outcome of the 2018 Global Compact on Migration.
Nepal calls for concerted efforts at the national, regional and international levels to ensure that the migration process creates a fair and win-win situation to all.
We call for safety, security, dignity and well-being of all migrant workers.
Although not a party to the Refugee Convention and its Protocol, Nepal has earnestly upheld humanitarian principles by hosting thousands of refugees.
Protection of minorities and their rights makes the world more humane, and contributes to world peace and security.
Forced eviction of citizens is a grave crime against humanity. We call upon the international community to respond responsibly and act decisively for refugees’ right to return to their homeland in safety and dignity and rapid rehabilitation under all circumstances.
Mr. President 
The cost of natural disasters is rising sharply in terms of human tragedy and devastation. We call for greater global cooperation and coordination in prevention, mitigation and recovery.
The trauma of Nepal earthquake 2015 has not subsided yet. The post-disaster reconstruction is ongoing. We thank our neighbours, development partners, other friendly countries and UN family for their generous support in our reconstruction drive.
Poor and vulnerable countries disproportionately suffer from climate change despite their negligible role in greenhouse gas emissions. The implementation of Paris Agreement should be done in synergy with the 2030 Agenda. The principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, equity and respective capabilities should be at the center of its implementation.
Mr. President,
The LDCs are the most vulnerable group of countries. They cannot be perennially equated with dehumanizing conditions of poverty and under development.  They must be enabled to smoothly and sustainably graduate at an early date.
LDCs and LLDCs have not been able to benefit from the process of globalization.
They need reliable and sustainable financing, partnerships, and technology transfer to overcome their structural impediments.
As cost of doing trade is higher to the LLDCs than the coastal countries, development of multi-modal transport infrastructure and unhindered transit rights of landlocked nations are critical to their sustainable development.
We call for full implementation of the Istanbul Programme of Action, Vienna Programme of Action and Addis Ababa Action Agenda in full synergy and coherence with the 2030 Agenda.
The development potentials of South-South cooperation in terms of trade, investment and technology must be fully exploited.
Geographical proximity to India and China provides Nepal a rare opportunity to benefit from unprecedented economic transformation in its neighbourhood, opening up immense opportunity for trade and investment.
Mr. President,
We exercise political pluralism at home and believe in multipolarity in international relations.
The essence of Nepal’s foreign policy is Panchasheel –five principles of peaceful co-existence that are derived from the teachings of Lord Buddha-the enlightened son of Nepal.
These principles serve as foundations for managing harmonious relations among nations in this time of increasing uncertainty and turmoil.
We believe in nonalignment. In exercise of our independent foreign policy, we judge every issue on its merit without fear or favour.
We consider regional cooperation an important means for building trust and confidence among nations and making the best use of complementarities for shared prosperity.
Connectivity remains at the core of deeper integration and for creating a win-win situation.
Nepal firmly believes in the indispensability of the United Nations in multilateral affairs and global governance. All countries, particularly major powers have the responsibility to contribute to the global good by fulfilling the obligations and responsibilities.
The Security Council’s reform is long overdue. Under-representation of developing countries must be addressed in recognition of their growing contributions in shaping global agenda.
Reforms must be inclusive and representative in structure, transparent and efficient in procedure, and accountable and effective in delivery.
The Secretary-General’s reform proposals are a step forward. We believe a clear statement support of the Member States, such as the Declaration made earlier this week, helps make our organization fit-for-purpose.
Any repositioning of UN development agenda should address gaps, build synergy and improve the accountability, steering clear from the politicization of development under any guise.
Nepal supports the revitalization exercise of the UN General Assembly for streamlining its functions and ensuring fair gender and geographical representation at higher UN positions, among others.
Mr. President,
Before concluding, I would like to share some insights into Nepal’s recent developments.
Nepal’s transition to democracy from a decade long armed conflict through peaceful means demonstrates the power and promise of dialogue and negotiation over the perils of violent methods for political power. The national peace process that began in 2006 concluded with the promulgation of a democratic and inclusive constitution in 2015 through a popularly elected Constituent Assembly.
This unique peace process was home-grown and nationally-driven. Its successful conclusion has firmly established the culture of dialogue and accommodation, and could serve as a model for similar situations elsewhere. We appreciate the support and understanding provided by the international community.
Proportional representation of all sections of our society is at the core of Nepal’s inclusive democracy.
Recent local level elections have firmly established women’s role in politics and development. The constitution guarantees 40% women representation at the local level and one third in the federal and provincial parliaments.
After successful local level elections, held in 20 years, the dates have been announced for the provincial and federal parliaments in two months from now.
The ongoing transitional justice process combines our international commitment and ground reality of delivering justice and sustaining peace.
To conclude, Mr. President,
Let me reiterate Nepal’s profound commitment to the principles and purposes of the United Nations.
The United Nations is made of big and small nations. Vast majority of UN membership comes from smaller countries, confirming the universality and legitimacy of the world body. An edifice for a peaceful, stable, rule-based and just world order cannot be erected without addressing their genuine concerns for security, development and wellbeing.
We believe small nations have been sincere and serious in discharging their responsibilities as members of this body. Even with their negligible economic and security resources, they have been playing a constructive role under the aegis of the UN for promoting peace, security and cooperation under the most difficult circumstances in various parts of the world.
 I would like to recall the wise words of BP Koirala, the first elected Prime Minister of Nepal, who told the fifteenth Session of this august Assembly in 1960, and I quote “Our physical strength may be negligible, but our moral strength, if we are true to ourselves and to the peoples for whom we speak, may be great.” End of quote.
This statement is as relevant today as it was then.
Let us collectively display wisdom, knowledge and capacity to address the pressing issues of peace, security, disarmament and sustainable development with due respect to the internationally accepted rules to ensure a safe and stable world order.
I thank you all.

Statement by Hon’ble Mr. Giriraj Mani Pokharel, Minister of Health and Foreign Affairs at the Program of International Day of Peace and unveiling of the Nepali UN Peacekeepers’ Memorial Plaque in the UN House on 20th September 2017 at the UN House, Lalitpur
 
United Nations Resident Coordinator Madam Valerie Julliand,
Excellencies,
Distinguished representatives and Officials of the UN System and international organizations,
Chiefs of Nepal Army, Nepal Police and Nepal Armed Police Force,
Family members of Nepali UN peacekeepers who sacrificed their lives in the line of duty for world peace
Ladies and Gentlemen!
 
I feel honored and privileged to be amongst you at this august gathering organized this morning on the occasion of the International Day of Peace that is celebrated worldwide on 21st September every year. Tomorrow is our national holiday on the occasion of the first day (Ghatasthapana) of great Festival Vijaya Dashami. I also take this opportunity, on the occasion of Vijaya Dashami of B.S. 2074, to extend my sincere greetings for good health, happiness, peace and prosperity to you all in the days to come.
At the outset, I would like, on behalf of the Government of Nepal, to express sincere thanks to the United Nations for organizing this program at which we just jointly unveiled a Memorial Plaque in memory of Nepali UN Peacekeepers. It is a fitting occasion to pay homage to Nepali UN Peacekeepers who have made their supreme sacrifice of their lives in the line of their duty in different times.
This year’s global theme of the International Day of Peace for 2017 is “Together for Peace: Respect, Safety and Dignity for All.”  The theme is timely and most appropriate for all members of the United Nations. Nepal has always underlined the need for unity and concerted efforts of all UN members towards achieving the goals of international peace and security, sustainable development and respect for human rights of all people around the world based on the cardinal principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter.
I would like to reiterate, on behalf of the Government of Nepal, its unflinching faith and commitment to the United Nations Charter. Nepal, a peace-loving member of the UN, has taken on the Organization as an international instrument of collective security for world’s peace and stability.  Since becoming its member on 14 December 1955, Nepal has consistently participated in the activities of the United Nations and strived for making the Organization more effective in its vision and mission in a global partnership for peace and solidarity.
You may already know that leading a Nepali delegation the Right Honorable Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba has left Kathmandu just yesterday evening for New York to participate in the ongoing 72nd Session of the United Nations General Assembly. Our regular participation in the General Assembly and other organs of the United Nations attests our commitment and resolution towards the Organization.
Furthermore, Nepal’s contributions to the maintenance of international peace, security and stability through the United Nations Peacekeeping Missions since 1958 have been well recognized and received by the international community. Nepal takes pride in her consistent contributions to the noble endeavor for collective security and world peace over six decades. We consider that the spirit of together under the umbrella of the United Nations is well served since UN peacekeeping efforts represent the most significant and successful achievement of the Organization for sustainable peace and prosperity for all.
We have noticed that UN peacekeeping missions have constantly been evolved during the past seven decades in terms of their mandates and effectiveness in the changed contexts of a multi-polar world. The numbers of UN peacekeepers and troop contributing countries and UN Missions have substantively increased. Since the Brahimi Report of 2001, the nature of deployment of troops has also been redefined with a view to creating lasting peace and stability, and preventing and managing conflicts around the world.
It is both an opportunity and challenge for Nepali UN Peacekeepers to perform their duty with Blue Helmets. The Government of Nepal would like to express its sincere appreciation to the United Nations for providing opportunities to the Nepal Army, Nepal police and Nepal Armed Police Force as uniformed or civilian personnel to serve various United Nations peacekeeping, peace-building and peacemaking missions around the world. Nepali UN peacekeepers have demonstrated their selfless dedication and commitment with high professionalism as required by the mandates of their respective missions as many as 42 out of 71 UN Peacekeeping Operations during the past six decades. So far, Nepal has contributed over 126, 000 peacekeepers and is currently the sixth largest troops contributing country. Even at present, 5200 plus Nepali UN peacekeepers are on duty in 15 out 16 UN peacekeeping missions from Sudan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti all corners of the world.
While we commend all Nepali UN peacekeepers, 76 of them have lost their lives in the line of duty in about 20 missions during the six decades. It is therefore a pious occasion to pay homage to them and give applause to their family members who have lost their dear ones. Nepal along with 193 UN members would remember them as brave Nepali Blue Helmets in memory of their service for common humanity.
The Government of Nepal has laid emphasis on impartiality, dedication and professional excellence of Nepali peacekeepers that is the hallmark of Nepal’s participation. Efforts are made for inclusive participation of female peacekeepers in different missions to improve gender parity in the peacekeeping missions.
With a view to making peacekeeping effective, responsible and accountable, Nepal considers that the core principles of the UN peacekeeping, such as consent of the parties, impartiality and the non-use of force except in self-defense and defense of the mandate should form the fundamental basis for the legitimate role of the UN peacekeeping operations.
We have internalized and integrated into policy relevant norms and standards on peacekeeping, including the Kigali Principles on the Protection of Civilians. Nepal believes that host government should ensure safety and security of the lives and dignity of the peacekeepers and civilian population. Therefore, we feel that collective and shared interest of better peacekeeping requires the close support and coordination of all stakeholders. The United Nations must support troops contributing countries for strengthening professionalism and capability of peacekeepers and senior leadership.
Nepal has always responded positively and promptly to the call of the United Nations and sent troops and civilian personnel at the shortest of calls, also in relatively difficult missions, which is a testimony to our commitment to world peace. The Nepal Army, Nepal Police and the Armed Police Force have all integrated the UN policies regarding protection of civilians, sexual exploitation or abuse, and protection of human rights into the pre-deployment training of peacekeepers. The Nepali peacekeepers and officials receive pre-deployment trainings with focus on challenges associated with the protection of civilians. In light with these commitments to the highest standards of peacekeeping, it is imperative that troops contributing countries should also have an enhanced sense of ownership in the whole process of peacekeeping.
It is our firm belief that balanced, fair and equitable opportunities for recruitment in senior positions from the Troops and Police Contributing Countries will enhance the inclusive character of the Secretariat and field missions and further enhances their effectiveness.
You may be aware that just yesterday we celebrated the third anniversary of the proclamation of the new Constitution. The cycle of local level elections has completed just two days ago. The Federal Parliament and Provincial elections have already been scheduled in November and December this year. After all these elections governance at all levels will be entirely in the hands of elected representatives that will enhance acceptability and implementation of the Constitution by all Nepali people.
Last but not the least, the Government of Nepal attaches high importance to partnership with the United Nations in the attainment of its goal of international peace, security and sustainable development around the world. As in the past, Nepal will continue to make its utmost efforts to respond to the call of the United Nations to make a safe and better world.

Thank you all for your kind attention.

Statement by Hon’ble Mr. Krishna Bahadur Mahara, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Nepal on “Nepal-China Partnership for Trans-Himalayan Development” At China Foreign Affairs University, Beijing
08 September 2017
 
 
President of the Foreign Affairs University of China
Esteemed Professors
Scholars and Academicians
Dear Students
Friends from Media 
Ladies and Gentlemen
 
It is my pleasure and honour to be amongst learned scholars, academics, youthful students, media persons and friends of Nepal. I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to the President of the University for extending kind invitation to join you all today.
I am standing in front of you in the University, which is the only institution of higher learning under the guidance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People’s Republic of China.
The University has an illustrious history and legacy whose roots are imbedded in the birth of new China. Since its establishment in 1955 under the visionary inspiration of Premier Zhou Enlai, this University has been producing experts, professionals and think tanks in the fields of diplomacy, foreign affairs and international relations .
Thousands of professionals and students from many countries around the globe including Nepal have been trained or educated in this University. We deeply appreciate and thank the University for providing opportunities of training and higher studies for Nepali students.
Dear Friends, 
Today, I will be speaking to you on the theme ‘Nepal-China Partnership for Trans-Himalayan Development’. The theme is selected in the context of growing engagements in socio-economic development between our two countries. Before going to the core part of the topic, let me share with you the historical relationship between our two countries.
Nepal and China are the nations with civilizational linkages. These linkages date back to antiquity and have co-existed and matured with the passage of time.
People-to-people relations have a long history. The teachings of Shakyamuni Buddha- an enlightened son of Nepal- have a special place in our relations. The visits of Nepali monks, scholars and artists to China such as Buddhabhadra in early 5th century, the marriage of Nepali Princess Bhrikuti to Tibetan King in first half of the 7th century and Araniko in the second half of 13th century are testimony to strong historical connections between our two countries.
Likewise, the story of life and teachings of Shakyamuni made it possible for the Chinese monks and scholars like Monk Fa Hsian and Monk Xuan Zang to explore Nepal and pursue knowledge. They were not only acquainted with Buddhism but also laid a strong bond of relations between our two countries.
Our visionary leaders laid the political foundations for friendship and good neighborliness with the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1955 is constantly nurtured and developed by the successive leaderships.
Since then, our countries have seen numerous changes and transformations both at home and abroad. But, Nepal-China relations are steadily growing and setting new milestones and benchmarks irrespective of changes in both countries and outside world.  Our relationship serves as a model of relationship between the countries of different sizes and social systems. We enjoy trouble-free relationship.
Nepal is firm in its commitment to One China Policy. We do not allow our territory for any elements to work against the interests of our neighbours. No matter which political parties lead the government in Nepal, our friendship with China has always remained close and cordial.  This is the uniqueness of Nepal-China relations.
Our relations are founded on the principles of peaceful co-existence. Moreover, the principles of sovereign equality, non-interference and respect for each other’s sensitivities are the defining features of Nepal-China relations.
Dear Friends
Our political relations are underpinned by strong economic cooperation and partnership. We consider China as our reliable and trusted partner for our socio-economic progress and transformation. Our partnership transcends all human interactions.
Nepal was struck by a devastating earthquake in April 2015. The generous support extended by China to Nepal in disaster relief and rescue efforts as well as in the ongoing post-disaster reconstruction truly signifies the breadth, depth and warmth of our relationship. We deeply cherish our friendship with this great friendly neighbour. Nepal’s foreign policy accords top priority to relations with our immediate neighbours. And, we are happy to note that China has also given priority to its relations with neighbours by adopting the policy of peripheral development.
It is a fact that global economic growth today hinges on the performance of major economies, notably the Chinese economy. China’s peaceful development has been possible by the farsightedness and commitment of the Chinese leadership supported by hardworking and dedicated Chinese people. Today, China is truly a global economic powerhouse. It gives it an important role to play in promoting world peace, development and stability. The economic performance of China and the unprecedented development transformation it has achieved remain a source of inspiration and emulation for many developing countries.
Dear Friends, 
China’s One Belt One Road Initiative offers opportunities for collaboration and partnership. I would like to thank and appreciate President Xi Jinping for taking this visionary initiative. Development of infrastructure, improvement of physical connectivity, fair trade, investment, tourism and people-to-people relations are some of the areas in which we have vital interest. The most important expectation of Nepali people is their strong desire to realize the construction railways linking Nepal’s major cities with northern border. I hope this is a genuine demand and can be fulfilled with Chinese resources and state-of-the- art technology. Top leaders in both countries have committed to working towards this end.
In realizing Nepal’s aspirations for development and prosperity, we have already started a journey. By signing the cooperation MoU under the BRI in May 2017 we have upscaled our partnership.
Nepal has set the vision for attaining a middle-income status by 2030. But, we face several structural bottlenecks in our economy to realize this vision despite ample possibilities in terms of human and natural resources, country’s position and potentials. It is our expectation that the special development needs and requirements of countries like Nepal, which is an LDC and LLDC, will be given due consideration under BRI.
Nepal can no longer afford to be languishing in poverty while our neighbours make incredible progress in every sphere. We have already set the political course. Our focus is on economic development. We believe that an edifice for a peaceful and stable country can be erected only on the strong foundation of economic development and prosperity. Economic distress remains at the core of political instability. A peaceful, stable and prosperous Nepal will be in the interest of our neighbours as well.
Dear Friends 
Nepal and China face each other across the Himalayas, and are linked by mountains and rivers. For millennia, the peoples of our countries have entered into commercial and cultural contact with each other despite the high Himalayas separating them, which has served as a link for our peoples, not as a barrier.
Looking at our partnership through an historic perspective, the Himalayas had remained the thoroughfare in our commercial interactions, cultural and people-to-people exchanges. Just over one century ago, Nepal itself used to be a vibrant trade entrépot that connected parts of North and Central Asia with South Asia.
We have several avenues for partnership and collaboration. Recently, we have concluded important instruments to consolidate and expand our cooperation. We have committed to fully implementing the agreements and understandings reached in the past and ensuring deliverable for the benefits of our people. And, most importantly, our bilateral engagements and business linkages are major platforms to transform the prospects for growth and prosperity into reality. Last month we have signed an important MoU to improve investment climate and economic partnership between Nepal and China.
Early in March, we hosted Nepal Investment Summit-2017. The summit set a good example of what we can do in partnership. Of total investment pledges, more than 60 percent came from Chinese investors. Joint efforts and promotion are essential to realize such interest into reality for our mutual interest.
Currently China is the largest source of our FDI. It is growing and helping us to set the industrialization process encompassing the areas from construction to communication, tourism to transport, road to railway.
The Nepal-China Non-governmental Cooperation Forum remains active to promote the partnership in the private sector. In May 2017, the Forum organized its 14th Meeting in Kathmandu. Important exchanges were made among the businessperson and entrepreneurs on the matters such as new energy, including hydropower; hardware and building materials trade and tourism. On the margin of the Forum, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed by Nepal Association of Tour and Travel Agents (NATTA) and China Chamber of Tourism (CCT) to promote tourism between the two countries. Such initiative is a welcome step in deepening relations for mutual benefits in the private sector.
Last month, we successfully organized Nepal-China business forum to share views on enhancing partnership in trade sector and to contribute to the sustainable trade development between Nepal and China. But our partnership has to go a long way to seize the benefits in trade sector. Trade scenario is not satisfactory. We need more trade facilitating measures from China to arrest the growing trade deficit. We have the plan to work together for Nepal-China FTA and establishment of cross border cooperation and industrial zones.
Tourism sector has tremendous potential to transform the dynamics of our relations by bringing the people at the center stage. China is our second largest source of tourists. Still we need to take up joint actions to fully unleash the tourism potentials. It brings our people closer and contributes to our economies.
Nepal is the land of Shakyamuni Buddha- the light of Asia and fountain of peace, the land of Everest and the Himalayas. Nepal has diverse and rich culture, pristine nature, scenic and adventurous spots for all kind of visitors. Despite these cultural and natural heritages, we still lack adequate publicity of these attractions among the Chinese people.
We thank the Chinese Government for designating 2017 as Nepal Tourism Promotion Year in China. Last month, Nepal hosted a familiarization trip to media persons from China with the aim of familiarizing our tourism attractions among the Chinese people.  As a token of friendship, we have been providing cost free visa to the Chinese visitors to Nepal.
We need supports from all sectors to give publicity to our tourism attractions among the Chinese friends. The major tourist destinations of Nepal can be publicized in major cities and in the public transport means of China such as rail and buses. We are seeking to utilize the mass media and popular online platforms of China to this end.
Dear Friends, 
Connectivity is key to our relationship.  It is a key enabler for development, lack of which hampers the process of development. We have overland routes through our border and air connectivity between cities. Yet, building cross-border railways, transmission lines, new roadways, transit corridors and info-ways would go a long way in transforming our development landscape.
Connectivity and transit transport facilities means a lot to a landlocked country like Nepal. In 2016, we signed Agreement on Transit Transport. Recently, we have started substantial work on the conclusion of its Protocol.
We have agreed to open, improve and upgrade our border points. Resumption of Tatopani/Zhangmu border point at the earliest is our priority. It holds both historic significance and current imperative in our partnership.
Energy security is crucial for economic development. Nepal is endowed with huge water resources. This resource can be harnessed to develop a clean energy base and reducing over reliance on fossil fuel at a time when the world is grappling to overcome the adverse effects of climate change.  Investment in mega hydropower projects and related infrastructures can be beneficial to Nepal as well as Chinese investors.
The Chinese experience, ideas, innovation and engineering techniques for the development has established itself as the pioneer in railways, bridges, tunnel, expressways, agriculture, electronics, computing and smart technology. Such development experiences, ideas and technology are essential for our development drive. We want to draw from them, adapt them to address our development needs.
Nepal has demographic dividend. We have a large population of young and creative people. Our partnership in terms of investment can be instrumental in creating jobs for millions of youth who leave the country every day in large number in search of job opportunities overseas. This precious human asset must be used for the development of our own country.
Dear Friends, 
Our collaboration also extends to the education sector. Every year several hundred Nepali students have been pursuing higher education in China. China is increasingly becoming one of the most preferred foreign destinations for Nepali students. The wealth of knowledge acquired by Nepali students in diverse disciplines has contributed to fulfill our human resource gap in the country.
I am pleased to state here that the number of Chinese students studying in various institutes and universities of Nepal is also growing.
The number of Nepal studies Centers is also growing in different universities of China. This would help bring our peoples closer. At the same time, our universities can initiate joint academic works and academic exchanges programs.
The gravity of the world power (economic) is shifting towards Asia. It is also called the coming of the Asian Century where China has an important role to play. Our collective efforts can make this century, the Asian century, a century of growth, development and prosperity.
Similarly, our engagements in the Asian Infrastructure Bank, Shanghai Cooperation Organization and ACD supplement our collaboration and partnership. We also have the tradition of working closely at regional and multilateral levels to push forward the matter of mutual interest.
Dear Friends, 
As I said earlier, Nepal has undergone political transformation of historic proportions. Economic prosperity is now our topmost priority. We count on China’s continued support in our march towards economic transformation.
Before I conclude, allow me to thank Mr. President, for creating this platform, a platform for sharing my views on Nepal-China partnership for harnessing the prospects of growth and shared prosperity.
We must create a success story of partnership, a partnership for enduring prosperity and a partnership for transformation to visibly uplift the living standard of our people.
I thank you all!

प्रेस नोट
२०७४ भाद्र ११ गते आइतवार

उपस्थित सञ्चारकर्मी साथीहरू,


भारतका महामहिम प्रधानमन्त्री श्री नरेन्द्र मोदीको मैत्रीपूर्ण निमन्त्रणामा यही २०७४ साल भाद्र ७ देखि ११ सम्म भारतको ५ दिने राजकीय भ्रमण सम्पन्न गरी आज स्वदेश फर्केको छु ।



यस भ्रमणमा हाम्रो मुख्य प्राथमिकता नेपाल र भारत बीच विश्वासको आधारशिलालाई मजबुत बनाउने थियो । साथै¸ विश्वास र समझदारीमा आधारित सम्बन्धलाई दुबै देश र जनताको हितमा हुने गरी अझ फराकिलो र गहिरो बनाउँदै लैजाने दिशामा सहकार्यका लागि थप पहल गर्ने उद्देश्य रहेको थियो ।



बाढी तथा डुबानको समस्याको शीघ्र समाधान हुनुपर्ने वारेमा मैले गम्भीरताका साथ कुरा राखें । सीमाक्षेत्रमा हुने बाढी तथा डुबानको समस्याको दिर्घकालीन समाधानका लागि ठोस पहल गर्ने दिशामा संयुक्त नीरिक्षण लगायत तत्काल उपयुक्त उपाय अपनाउने सहमति भएको छ । मैले यो विषयलाई बिहारका मुख्य मन्त्रीसँगको भेटमा पनि राखेको छु ।



लामो समयदेखि अल्झेर बसेको पञ्चेश्वर बहुउद्देश्यीय परियोजनाको विस्तृत परियोजना प्रतिवेदन एक महिनाभित्र टुङ्ग्याउने विषयमा सहमति भएको छ । यस आयोजनाबाट नेपालले पाउने लाभलाई सुनिश्चित गर्दै यस प्रकृयालाई टुङ्गोमा पुर्याइने छ ।



अरुण तेश्रो र माथिल्लो कर्णाली जलविद्युत आयोजनाको कार्यान्वयनका लागि नेपाल सरकारले सम्झौता अनुरुपको सहजिकरणको कार्य गरिसकेको सन्दर्भमा ती आयोजनाको फाइनान्सियल क्लोजर थपिएको समयावधि भित्र सम्पन्न गर्नुपर्ने कुरामा नेपालले जोड दिएको छ ।



धेरै वर्षदेखि कार्यान्वयनमा आउन नसकेको टनकपुर बाँधमा हेड रेगुलेटर एवं नेपाल सीमासम्म भारतले निर्माण गर्नुपर्ने लिङ्क नहरको डीपीआरलाई भारतीय पक्षबाट अन्तिम रुप दिइएको जानकारी प्राप्त भएको छ ।



उर्जा व्यापार सम्झौताको मर्म अनुरुप यसमा अन्तर्निहित सबै पक्षहरुको कार्यान्वयनका लागि उपयुक्त उपायहरु अवलम्वन गर्दै जाने सहमति भएको छ । व्यापार सहजिकरणका लागि यसअघि सहमति भएका व्यापार नाकाहरु धनगढी गौरीफन्टा¸ गुलरिया मुर्तिया¸ जटही पिपरौन र पशुपतिनगर सुकियापोखरीको स्तरोन्नति गरी चालु गर्ने सहमति भएको छ ।



नेपाली कृषि तथा ‍औद्योगिक उत्पादनका बस्तुको भारतीय बजारमा सहज पहुँच बनाउन परीक्षण र प्रमाणीकरण प्रयोगशाला एवं क्वारेन्टाइन सेवा केन्द्र स्थापना गर्न दुबै पक्षले सहकार्य गर्ने सहमति भएको छ । नेपालले उपयोग गरिरहेको पारवहन सुविधालाई थप व्यवस्थित र सहज बनाउन तेश्रो मुलुकबाट नेपाल आउने Bulk Cargo र Railway Service सम्बन्धी Letter of Exchange लाई छिट्टै टुङ्गोमा पुर्याउने सहमति भएको छ ।



नेपालमा लगानीको वातावरण बनेकोले भारतको राजनीतिक नेतृत्व र निजी क्षेत्रलाई नेपालमा लगानीका लागि आग्रह गरेको छु । नेपालको पर्यटन क्षेत्रको विकासको सन्दर्भमा पनि महत्वपूर्ण कुराकानी भएको छ ।



यसका अतिरिक्त भारतको अनुदान सहयोगमा सुदूर पश्चिममा एक प्राविधिक शिक्षालय तथा तनहुँमा जीपी कोइराला श्वास प्रश्वास रोग नियन्त्रण केन्द्रको निर्माण गर्ने वारेमा सैद्धान्तिक सहमति भएको छ ।



त्यसैगरी‚ कुशीनगर लुम्बिनी तथा बर्दिबास बीरगंज रेलमार्ग¸ बीरगञ्ज पथलैया नारायणघाट तथा बुलवल पोखरा सडकलाई द्रुतमार्गका रुपमा स्तरोन्नति गर्ने¸ निजगढमा अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय विमानस्थल निर्माण गर्ने¸ महाकाली नदीमा पक्की पुलहरु निर्माण गर्ने¸ बीरगञ्ज रक्सौलमा मैत्री पुलको निर्माण गर्ने¸ दोधारा चाँदनीमा सुख्खा बन्दरगाह निर्माण गर्ने¸ नेपालमा एक विशेष आर्थिक क्षेत्र निर्माण गर्ने¸ नयाँ १३२ केभी ट्रान्समिशन लाइन निर्माण गर्ने¸ बुलवल गोरखपुर तथा लम्की बरेली ट्रान्समिशन लाइन निर्माण गर्ने सम्बन्धमा छलफल अगाडि बढाउने सहमति भएको छ ।



नेपाली नम्बर प्लेटका एलपीजी बुलेटको समस्या समाधान गरिदिन भारतीय प्रधानमन्त्रीलाई अनुरोध गरेको छु । उहाँले विद्यमान कानून अनुसार भारतीय नम्बरका एपीजी बुलेटले मात्र भारतमा एलपीजी ढुवानी गर्न सक्ने बारेमा अवगत गराउनु भएको छ । तथापि¸ यस बारेमा दुई पक्षीय कुराकानी जारी राख्न सकिने सुझाव प्राप्त भएको छ ।



भ्रमणका बखत भारतका प्रधानमन्त्री तथा मैले संयुक्त रुपमा कटैया कुशाहा तथा रक्सौल परवानीपुर ट्रान्समिशन लाइनको उदघाटन गर्यौं । यसबाट नेपालले तत्काल थप १०० मेगावाट विजुली प्राप्त गर्न सक्नेछ ।



साथै¸ आवास¸ शिक्षा¸ स्वास्थ्य तथा साँस्कृतिक सम्पदाको पुनर्निर्माणमा भारतले प्रदान गर्ने अनुदान उपयोग गर्ने¸ नेपाल र भारतका गुणस्तर निकायका बीच एकअर्काको मानकलाई मान्यता दिने¸ लागु औषधको माग न्यूनिकरण तथा अबैध माग ओसार पसार नियन्त्रण गर्ने¸ मेची पुलको निर्माण गर्ने तथा नेपाल र भारतका चार्टर्ड एकाउनटेन्टस संस्थाहरुका बीच सहयोग आदानप्रदान गर्ने सम्बन्धी आठवटा समझदारीहरु आदान प्रदान भएका छन् ।



क्षेत्रीय सहयोगलाई थप प्रबर्द्धन गर्नका निमित्त सार्क र बिमष्टेकलाई प्रभावकारी तुल्याउने सम्बन्धमा समेत समझदारी भएको छ ।



समग्रमा मेरो यस राजकीय भ्रमणका अवसरमा भएको उच्चस्तरी भेटघाटबाट दुई देशका वीच विश्वासको अभिवृद्धि गर्न मद्दत पुगेको छ । नेपालको सामाजिक आर्थिक विकासको लागि उर्जा¸ व्यापार¸ कनेक्टिभिटी¸ पर्यटन जस्ता महत्वपूर्ण क्षेत्रहरुमा सहयोग अभिबृद्धि हुने भएको छ । साथै¸ विगतमा सहमतिमा पुगिएका ठूला आयोजनाहरुको शीघ्र एवं प्रभावकारी कार्यान्वयनका लागि सकारात्मक वातावरण बनेको छ ।


धन्यबाद।

Remarks by the Rt. Hon. Sher Bahadur Deuba Prime Minister of Nepal 
India Foundation, August 24, 2017, New Delhi
 
Mr. Chairman,
Excellencies,
Distinguished friends,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
 
It is a privilege for me to be among this distinguished audience.
I feel honored to have been invited by the India Foundation to share my views on Nepal-India relations from the perspective of democracy and development.
At the outset, on behalf of the people and the Government of Nepal, I would like to extend to the people and the Government of India my warmest congratulations on the completion of your70years of Independence.
The progress that India has made in various sectors is an exemplary story of our times. Your achievements in the fields of science, technology, and social innovation has been a particular inspiration.
India has also proved that it is democracy that binds diverse societies together while promoting tolerance and individual dignity.
Democracy has been India’s gift to developing world.
Distinguished friends, 
We recall with pride the active participation of great Nepali leaders like B.P. Koirala in India’s freedom movement. They responded to the call of Gandhiji, boycotted government schools and joined the Quit India Movement in 1942.
B.P. Koirala taught us, and I quote, “democracy is indivisible, if you want democracy at home, you cannot afford to neglect all struggles for it.” End of quote.
He believed that when the British rule ends in India, it would be Nepal’s turn for democracy. He was prophetic.
In seven decades of struggle, democracy has seen ups and downs in Nepal.  We are grateful to the people and the Government of India for their goodwill and moral support for all democratic movements in Nepal since the 1950s.
After the historic people’s movement in 2006, Nepal today is in midst of a profound transformation. The constitution we promulgated in 2015 was written in the most democratic and inclusive manner.
It accommodates aspirations of diverse ethnic groups. It guarantees every woman right to lineage and right to property without discrimination. A full and fair gender balance is ensured in all high offices of state.
Still, we consider our constitution to be a living and dynamic document that is open to revisions as and when required.
Just three days ago, we voted on an important amendment to address the concerns raised by people from Tarai-Madhesh.  Though the amendment did not muster the two-thirds majority of votes required, the process brought to the forefront the wider acceptance and importance of the issues raised.
It is our commitment to redress grievances of our citizens.
As all of us know, democracy is a process.For  democracy to mature,it is necessary to overcome the legacy of the past.
We will take everybody along on the journey towards greater prosperity, inclusion and dignity.
Democracies must deliver to stay relevant in a world that is deeply inter-connected.  Today’s citizens demand better governance to advance their rising aspirations.
Dear friends,
Our foreign policy is dictated by the interest of the Nepali people and the principles of Panchasheel. The five principles of peaceful co-existence that are derived from the teachings of Siddhartha Gautam — the enlightened son of Nepal.
We judge every issue on its merits without fear or favour in consistent with our national interests, the principles and purposes of the United Nations, and principles of non-alignment.
Nepal’s foreign policy priority begins with its neighboring countries, and extending it to wider international community.
We consider trust as a pre-requisite to an enduring relationship.
Nepal  has clearly, and consistently made it clear  that under no circumstances Nepal would allow its soil to  be used against its neighbours or any other countries. We also expect them to be sensitive to Nepal’s concerns and sensitivities.
We believe that a strong, stable, peaceful, democratic, and prosperous Nepal is in our interests, in the interest of our neighbours, and the entire global community.
Nepal-India relations are unique and unparalleled in character. People of the two countries share special bonds and affinity.
From Janakpur to Ayodhya, Lumbini to Bodhgaya, or Pashupatinath to Vishwanath, we share a common set of values, culture and civilization.
The advent of democracy has further honed people-to-people contacts and deepened mutual trust across a wide spectrum.
Friends, 
Beyond solidarity, India is also one of our most important partners in development. It has been a reliable friend and neighbor in need and hardship.
We are grateful for India’s generous support towards socio-economic change, and humanitarian assistance in Nepal going back decades.
We also share several regional and global platforms. It is our firm conviction that international cooperation is not a choice but a compulsion. Nepal aspires to grow together with SAARC and BIMSTEC countries.
Our main priority is better connectivity of infrastructure, technology,energy, markets, ideas and high culture. We also seek meaningful cooperation in trade, investment, tourism and finance.
Transnational challenges such as terrorism, climate change, natural disasters, and food security pose a new generation of challenges.
Terrorism remains the biggest threat to peace, stability, development and democracy.Nepal condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. We call for concerted efforts to combat this menace.
In addition to natural hazards like the earthquakes of 2015, Nepal is also bearing the brunt of climate change despite negligible contribution to greenhouse gas emissions.
No country, however big and powerful, can deal with these transnational challenges alone. This demands stronger partnership and deeper collaboration among us all.
Distinguished friends,
It is my firm belief that economic prosperity and political freedoms must go hand in hand in the 21st century.
I consider that a few development challenges must be confronted together.
The first is about our young demography, and the challenge of finding decent, well-paying jobs on a mass scale at a time when the world is witnessing the fourth Industrial Revolution.
The second is about harnessing renewable resources, such as hydro-power, and mitigating climate change. How do we manage our common natural resources?
The third is probably the biggest generational challenge of our times. It is about ending absolute poverty by 2030, narrowing inequality within and across countries, and reducing vulnerabilities?
The fourth issue is to grapple with both the challenges and opportunities that come with intense urbanization. How do we build sustainable cities and prosperous villages?
And the fifth development challenge of our times will be to adapt to new patterns of production, trade and employment that are being disrupted by technological breakthroughs. How do we manage dislocation of established patterns of livelihoods?
I have only flagged these issues, and do not wish to elaborate today.
But my emphasis is on the fact that the more policy challenges become complex, the greater the salience of democracy to garner consensus and mediate likely conflicts.
Friends,
The world watches Asia with great interest today. While this region is the world’s brightest spot in the 21st century, there are also major challenges staring at us. We need to work together to make the most of existing opportunities.
A shared vision of prosperity based on the foundation of peace, stability and democracy, we hope, will uplift us all.
And we believe that Nepal and India — as one of the closest neighbors in the world — have a vital bearing on this march towards greater freedoms and progress.
Thank you and Namaste.

Statement by the Right Honorable Mr. Sher Bahadur Deuba Prime Minister of Nepal at the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry New Delhi, August 23, 2017
Posted onAugust 23, 2017 

Statement by the Right Honorable Mr. Sher Bahadur Deuba Prime Minister of Nepal at the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry
New Delhi, August 23, 2017

Mr. Chairperson,
Excellencies,
Presidents of the Chambers of Commerce and Industry,
Members of my delegation,
Ladies and gentlemen,
 
I am honored to address this august gathering of business leaders from India and Nepal. I feel that an interaction of this kind helps understand each other. They place us on the same page about the challenges and opportunities in both our countries.
Friends, I stand before you today with one simple message.
After years of policy stalemate and instability, Nepal is on the verge of a growth take-off. We are ready to gather pace, and we warmly invite you to engage with us. We welcome you to do business in Nepal, invest there, create jobs, and nurture a new climate of innovation and entrepreneurship.
I call upon both our business communities to work together. This is the only way to advance our goal of greater prosperity by building on the strong social ties and heritage that we share.
Ladies and gentlemen, 
Two years ago, in 2015, we ended political transition by adapting a highly progressive constitution. With the historic political gains secured, the mood in Nepal is to turn a page and move forward.
We now want to take on the generational challenge of rapid economic progress. And the time is right for many reasons.
First, there exists a strong convergence of views among Nepal’s major political parties that the country is poised to stand at a critical economic juncture. We cannot lose sight of this window of opportunity. Nepal is truly open for business.
Second, with the rise of India and China as global economic powers, all major growth poles in Asia are within a few hours of flying distance from Kathmandu. Nepal can be the new melting pot for tourists, traders and investors. Our landscape and culture of hospitality are an additional draw.
Third, we are restarting the next generation of economic reforms. In the early 1990s, we took a bold policy departure to make our economy dynamic. In my first term as Prime Minister over twenty years ago I introduced the Value-Added-Tax, similar to the GST launched recently in India. While reforms of that scale have not taken root since, this will now change. Just in the past few months, we have enacted laws and policies on foreign investment, public-private partnership, special economic zones, industrial enterprises, labor, mining, banking, and intellectual property.
Fourth, we are actively pursuing new processes and institutions to attract large-scale investment. The 900 megawatt Arun-3 and the 900 megawatt Upper Karnali hydropower projects both involve Indian capital and are being facilitated by the Investment Board of Nepal. Early this year, we hosted the Investment Summit where we attracted a pledge of 14 billion dollars, which is almost half the size of our GDP.
Fifth, we offer flexible rules and incentives on returns on capital and profit. As a least developed country, we enjoy duty-free access to the European market, and have recently received preferential market entry into the United States for over 60 products. Nepal is an attractive platform for export-oriented investments in products that have a high value-to-weight ratio. Our labor force is loyal, disciplined and affordable. And in an era of climate change, we aim to meet all our energy needs through clean sources. Nepal’s hydropower, for example, can spur high-energy high-tech sectors, and displace dirty sources of fuel across South Asia.
Let me also be honest with you. We are still a low-income country, and we have our share of struggles in building a functioning system of democratic government. Many of the attributes that I listed may not always be honored in practice in the spirit they are intended. But here is my solemn pledge to you. We will direct our most sincere efforts to court foreign investment, to secure and retain them, and to ensure they succeed.
Ladies and Gentlemen, 
Both India and Nepal today have large young population. In this fourth visit to India as Prime Minister, my goal is to look much more into the future than the past. In the interest of our youth, my talks with Prime Minister Modi will emphasize a forward-looking development agenda that is defined by collaboration on projects that can inspire our societies and transform our economies in the 21st century.
For a landlocked country, I am convinced that intense physical connectivity through roads, rail, and air is key to lowering business costs and deepening people-to-people ties.
Nepal today faces a large trade deficit with India. Our production base is weaker than it was 20 years ago. But with campaigns like “Make in India” we are hopeful that we can revive the successes of the mid-1990s. Through FDI, we are eager to participate in the scaling up to benefit from the regional value chain.
Hundreds of thousands of young Nepalis migrate overseas for gainful work that is not available at home. We are optimistic that we can revive our manufacturing and create jobs in large numbers by partnerships with industries from India.
We are also inspired by the scale of ambition of India’s IT sector; and the vast social innovations aimed at lifting the poor, and improving the quality of governance.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I believe that great political changes must go hand-in-hand with socio-economic progress. Otherwise, the legitimacy of the political gains made dissipates.
It is for this reason that our young republic has no choice but to amplify its economic ambition. Our vision for Nepal by 2030, therefore, is to make it a vibrant middle-income country. We want our society to celebrate risk-taking, entrepreneurship and wealth creation.
Only with this change in mindset can Nepal pave the way for massive mobilization of private investment. On my part, dear friends, let me conclude with three basic commitments:
(1). We will do all we can to signal signs of reforms that are credible and not reversible.
(2). I will do my best to relax the most binding constraints in infrastructure.
(3). Through institutional reforms that simplify procedures, deter rent-seeking, and create a level playing field, I assure you that you will be part of an historic process of structural transformation in a country where people’s potentials are yet to be realized and the bounty of our natural resources are yet to be tapped.
By enriching our bilateral ties — through the force of commerce, production and exchange — I am hopeful that we can elevate our relationship to levels never seen before.
Thank you and Namaste!

Welcome Remarks by Hon’ble Mr. Krishna Bahadur Mahara, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Nepal at the Inaugural Session of the Fifteenth BIMSTEC Ministerial Meeting Kathmandu, Nepal, 10 August 2017

Welcome Remarks by Hon’ble Mr. Krishna Bahadur Mahara, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Nepal at the Inaugural Session of the Fifteenth BIMSTEC Ministerial Meeting
Kathmandu, Nepal
10 August 2017
 
The Right Honourable Prime Minister of Nepal,
The Honourable Foreign/External Affairs Ministers of BIMSTEC Member States,
Mr. Secretary General of BIMSTEC
Excellencies,
Distinguished Delegates,
Friends from Media,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Namaste and good evening!
I extend a warm welcome to our distinguished guests in Nepal, the land of Gautam Buddha and Mount Everest, and at this Inaugural Session of the Fifteenth Session of BIMSTEC Ministerial Meeting.
I am grateful to honorable Foreign/External Affairs Ministers and Deputy Foreign Ministers of BIMSTEC Member States for accepting our invitation to attend this Meeting at a short notice and despite of your busy schedules.
I express sincere appreciation to The Right Honourable Prime Minister for kindly agreeing to be our chief guest and deliver the Inaugural address.
This is the first highest-ranking BIMSTEC meeting we are hosting in Nepal since the assumption of the chairmanship in March 2014.
And, I am happy to note that this meeting is taking place in the 20th anniversary year of the founding of BIMSTEC. Hope, this will inspire all of us to make our meeting highly productive through our collective efforts.
BIMSTEC is a unique platform that connects South Asia with South-east Asia and links the two vibrant growth poles. There are strong bonds of cultural affinity between our two sub-regions.
Honorable Ministers and Excellencies, 
In recent times, we have been witnessing economic dynamism at both regional and global levels fuelled by globalization, technological innovation and deeper interconnectedness. The formation of BIMSTEC twenty years ago was a thoughtful response to realize the opportunities of globalization and shifting of economic locus towards Asia.
Our region is endowed with rich natural resources, vibrant populations and diverse cultural heritages. Given the huge untapped potentials, there is every reason to believe that BIMSTEC could emerge as a formidable economic force in the world. What is required is a sincere pursuit of regional cooperation with the common understanding that deeper integration results in win-win situation for all constituent member states. Landlocked and least developed member states have special development challenges that warrant serious consideration by all.
Visible progress is required in core economic areas such as connectivity, trade, tourism, energy, and agriculture. Connectivity of all kinds, trade and investment cooperation, energy cooperation, use of information and technology are key enablers for bringing about structural as well as socio-economic transformation in the region.
Excellencies, 
Our two decades of journey has been a mixed bag of achievements and shortcomings. We note that progress has been achieved in some areas of cooperation, namely trade, energy, transport, tourism and institutional development of the organization. However, progress has been slow and below our expectations. Our progress does not match our potentials. We need to do much more and our business-as-usual approach has to be changed.
The BRICS-BIMSTEC Outreach Summit and the subsequent BIMSTEC Leaders Retreat hosted by His Excellency the Prime Minister of India in Goa, 2016, has given a new impetus to the BIMSTEC process. I believe the deliberations at the Summit and the Outcome Document of the Retreat have further reinvigorated our collective efforts and reinforced our commitments in this regard.
20th anniversary is an opportunity for us to elevate the visibility of BIMSTEC regionally and globally and enrich its substance for a meaningful regional cooperation. Various programs have been organized to celebrate the 20th anniversary of BIMSTEC.
Excellencies, 
For developing and least developed economies like ours, and even the developed countries alike, trade is an engine for economic growth. An early conclusion of the agreements on trade in goods, trade in services, investment, mutual assistance in customs matters, dispute settlement and trade facilitation is of paramount importance.
Poverty is our common enemy. It continues to stare at us. The ultimate goal of our regional collaboration has been and should be to uplift our people from the clutches of poverty and enable them to lead a life that is dignified.
This cannot be achieved easily. We must make collective efforts to fully and sincerely implement the Poverty Plan of Action. As the lead country, Nepal remains committed to advance regional cooperation process in this field, learning from our success in the implementation of MDGs and also in preparation of regional framework for SDGs.
Development cannot take place in the absence of connectivity. Transport connectivity and energy cooperation are critical to boost our productive capacity and to promote intra-regional trade. The updating and enhancement of BIMSTEC Transport Infrastructure and Logistic Study (BTILS) and the formation of the BIMSTEC Transport Connectivity Working Group (BTCWG) have been a right step forward in this direction. We call for early conclusion of Motor Vehicles Agreement and Costal Shipping Agreement. We must complete BIMSTEC Master Plan for Connectivity at the earliest. Effective and early operationalization of the BIMSTEC Energy Center and conclusion of MoU on BIMSTEC Grid Interconnection will help significantly expand connectivity.
Tourism must receive priority in our cooperative efforts. The establishment of BIMSTEC Tourism Fund and the work towards establishing BIMSTEC Buddhist Circuit are encouraging signs of our joint collaboration for tapping the huge tourism potentials of the region.
Excellencies, 
It is interesting to note that globalization has made it easier for both tourists and terrorists to travel around. The current world is empowering not only the delivery of growth and prosperity but it has also empowered the delivery of dangers. Our region is not immune from the dangers of terrorism, organized crimes, drugs trafficking, human trafficking and money laundering, among others. Enhanced level of cooperation and coordinated efforts at various levels help us overcome these evils.
Strong regional collaboration and partnership are equally indispensable for overcoming manifold disturbances of harmonious human growth such as the problems of climate change, natural disasters and public health. Conservation of mountain eco-systems including biodiversity is essential for sustainable development of our region.
Closer cultural relationships among our people and cordial people-to-people contacts strengthen the foundation for peace, progress and prosperity in the region and discard threats of poverty, illnesses and crimes from our soil.
I have touched upon some core issues. There may be many more other issues calling for our attention. I do not intend to delve into detail now as we will have enough time tomorrow to deliberate under our agenda items.
Excellencies, 
History has given us a chance to transform the development landscape of BIMSTEC. We must collectively seize this opportunity. I believe that our collective security lies in our collective prosperity.Collective prosperity cannot be achieved without a meaningful regional cooperation. Our thoughts and action on regional cooperation must be informed by this vision.
I wish to underline that with our strong collaboration we can fulfill the aim of regional economic integration;can achieve social progress; and can enjoy shared prosperity within the region.
My country, Nepal, attaches great importance to regional cooperation. Guided by our foreign policy priority, we remain fully committed to the goals and objectives of BIMSTEC.
I look forward to a productive discussion tomorrow.With these words, I conclude my welcome remarks.
I welcome you all once again and extend my best wishes for your pleasant stay in Kathmandu.
Thank you.

Inaugural Address by The Rt. Hon’ble Prime Minister Mr. Sher Bahadur Deuba, at the Fifteenth BIMSTEC Ministerial Meeting in Kathmandu, Nepal
10 August 2017
 
Honourable Foreign/External Affairs Ministers and Deputy Foreign Ministers of BIMSTEC Member States,
Mr. Secretary General of BIMSTEC,
Excellencies,
Distinguished Delegates,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Good evening and Namaste!
It gives me immense pleasure to address the inaugural session of the Fifteenth BIMSTEC Ministerial Meeting.
I wish to extend a very warm welcome and pleasant stay to all of you in Nepal.
The establishment of BIMSTEC twenty years ago was a milestone in regional cooperation. I recall with pleasure my participation at the very first BIMSTEC Summit held in Bangkok in 2004. I was leading the Nepali delegation as Prime Minister at this Summit when Nepal joined BIMSTEC as a full-fledged member. I would like to commend all those engaged for maintaining the momentum of the BIMSTEC process.
BIMSTEC is a bridge connecting two dynamic sub-regions of Asia.This region houses more than a fifth of the world population, a majority of which are youth.
Both these sub-regions are blessed with vast and diverse natural resources ranging from the deep seas to the high mountains. If these resources are harnessed properly and utilized efficiently, prosperity will not be out of reach of our peoples.
The region remains connected by shared culture, history and geography. Buddhism that regards all human beings as equal is our common bond and belief. Diverse and rich cultural heritages make our region a miniature world in itself. This Region’s unity and harmony amidst vast diversity provide a strong foundation for cooperation the success of which lies in the level of commitment, understanding and partnership.
Excellencies!
The BIMSTEC region, like any other region, confronts the dangers of transnational crimes. Militant extremism, human, arms and drug trafficking have deeply disturbed peace and harmony in our societies.
Terrorism continues to be the greatest threat to peace, democracy, development and good neighbourliness. Nepal firmly and unequivocally condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. Terrorism cannot be justified on any grounds.
Poverty remains the most formidable challenge in our path to growth and prosperity. We must collectively and decisively overcome this challenge to enable our people’s right to live with dignity and honour.
Climate change, natural calamities and disasters also pose serious threats to our very survival.  To talk of my own country, Nepal is vulnerable to natural disasters as evidenced by the great earthquakes in 2015. We are also bearing the brunt of climate change despite our negligible contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. To combat all these challenges, we need stronger partnership and deeper collaboration among ourselves.
At this juncture, I would like to express sincere thanks to BIMSTEC members for their support in the aftermath of the 2015 earthquakes.
Distinguished delegates!
Let me briefly share current political developments in Nepal. Our topmost priority has been to implement the Constitution promulgated by an elected Constituent Assembly in September 2015. The Constitution provides a federal set-up and ensures inclusive governance and democratic pluralism. In line with the constitutional mandate, we organized elections at the local level and remain firmly committed to holding the remaining elections at the local, provincial and federal levels. We are engaged with all political stakeholders to create a more conducive environment to encourage the broadest possible political participation in all the upcoming elections.
I take this opportunity to sincerely appreciate the continued support and solidarity shown by our fellow BIMISTEC members in this historic democratic transition.
As this transformation concludes, accelerated economic development with social justice and environment sustainability will continue to be at the top of our national development agenda. After years of struggle for democratic order, people of Nepal deserve a better quality of life.  I am firmly committed to making serious efforts for the recovery of lost development decades. I believe that a successful democratic process must deliver development dividends. I also believe that regional cooperation and integration will remain critical for accelerating rapid economic growth and social progress of my country.
Excellencies!
Regional cooperation remains an important element in Nepal’s foreign policy. We believe that regional cooperation is not a choice but a compulsion. In this age of globalization and economic interdependence, it is but natural for Nepal to aspire to grow together with the region. We want to contribute to the realization of a vibrant and dynamic economic region that is also a peaceful and harmonious. Our success, as a regional grouping, will lie in our collective efforts to ensure that deeper integration benefits all member states in an equitable way. Member countries of BIMSTEC are at different stages of social and economic development, thus BIMSTEC must give due attention to the differential needs of its members in order to be effective as a regional grouping.
Excellencies!
We live in a period of opportunities and challenges, complexities and contradictions. We need to carefully and consciously venture into the future with common and focused purpose. It is imperative for us to choose a path of partnership, collaboration and cooperation.
I am happy to note that Panchsheel–the five principles of peaceful co-existence -that are derived from the teachings of Lord Buddha, provides an enduring framework for managing harmonious interstate relations. I believe these principles make meaningful contributions in promoting peace, stability, security and development, which are key aims of BIMSTEC.
Asia holds the key to the future of the world and the BIMSTEC region remains an important part of the Asian community. We need to ensure physical and digital connectivity, as well as connectivity of mind, especially, among researchers and visionary thinkers across the region in order to archive our collective goals.
Excellencies!
As we mark the twentieth anniversary, let this occasion be the turning point in the history of BIMSTEC!
May this occasion inspire us towards enhanced vigor, revitalized energy and unyielding zeal to take this region to a new height of progress and prosperity!
In this context, I would also like to underscore that this is the right moment to focus on deepening rather than widening the areas of cooperation.
Let us pledge to our people that, by the end of year 2017, negotiations of all existing key instruments of the regional cooperation framework, be it in trade, investment or connectivity, become conclusive, and mechanisms relating to energy,  technology, and weather and climate become fully functional.
Let us also pledge to our people that, from the year 2018 onwards, we commence to deliver results and outcomes.
Nepal remains firmly committed to the objectives and ideals of BIMSTEC.
Finally, I would like to extend my best wishes for productive deliberations.
I look forward to fruitful outcomes of the Ministerial Meeting.
Thank you!

Statement by Hon. Dr. Min Bahadur Shrestha, Vice-Chairman of the National Planning Commission of Nepal and the Head of Nepali Delegation to the High-Level Political Forum (HLPF) under the auspices of the UN-ECOSOC
(New York, 18 July 2017)
As delivered
 
Mr. President,
As we embark on turning the transformative Sustainable Development Goals into reality, we must focus on actions to make a qualitative difference in the lives of our people.The theme that we are deliberating today ‘Eradicating poverty and promoting prosperity in a changing world’ rightly captures this need as well as the essence of SDGs.
I align my statement with those delivered on behalf of G-77 and China, LLDCs and LDCs.
Mr. President,
In Nepal, the 2030 Agenda enjoys strong underpinning of the country’s Constitution itself. The rights-based Constitution provides an inclusive framework for sustainable development by guaranteeing rights to multiple development dimensions, such as health, education and clean environment.
The current development priority of Nepal is to build on the achievements of MDGs, and focus fully on realising SDGs. It demands that our constraints relating to capacity, institutions and resources are fully addressed.
It was with this in mind that Nepal undertook policy initiatives for mainstreaming and localizing SDGs into its national plans and programmes immediately after the adoption of the 2030 Agenda. And, I was honoured to present Nepal’s Voluntary National Review at this Forum yesterday, mapping out our constraints, gaps and promises ahead.
Above all, Nepal’s development path is beset with structural challenges such as landlockedness as well as with vulnerabilities to climate change and natural disasters.
Undeterred, though, we have mustered all the strength and relentless efforts in the hope to fully achieve SDGs. Nonetheless, we are aware that our efforts would not be enough.
Mr. President,
‘Leaving no one behind’ is the mantra we agreed on while adopting the SDGs. The 2030 Agenda calls for generous international partnerships to fill the technological and resource gaps. We should create enabling environments for LDCs and LLDCs to fully utilize their potentials as agreed in Istanbul Program of Action and Vienna Program of Action. In this regard, Nepal stresses that means of implementation commitments must match with the actions.
Equally important is to ensure equitable benefits from the international trading and financial systems.Development partners and stakeholders need to support and complement the national efforts of countries in special situation in the spirit of solidarity– the foundation of the 2030 Agenda.System-wide coherence needs to be maintained within the UN system for it to be ‘fit for purpose’ and to ‘deliver as one’ on the ground.
Clearly, the current level of global efforts and partnerships remains inadequate. While Nepal is committed to do its best by forging partnerships among public, private and cooperative sectors at home, it looks forward to increased cooperation from development partners in terms of ODA, meaningful partnerships as well as technology facilitation and transfer.
Mr. President,
As the central platform for follow-up and review of the 2030 Agenda, this Forum has an important responsibility to ensure that all our efforts are consistent and sustained. Its credibility will depend on its ability to provide constant political leadership for the agenda’s implementation and in ensuring that no one is left behind. Nepal stands ready to working with the international community towards that direction.
I thank you, Mr. President!

Nepal’s Voluntary National Review (VNR) statement presented by Honorable Dr. Min Bahadur Shrestha,Vice Chairman, National Planning Commission and the Head of Nepali Delegation to the High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) 
17 July 2017, New York
As delivered
 
Mr. President,
Let me first commend your leadership of ECOSOC in convening the High Level Political Forum this year as well as for the meticulous preparation for Voluntary National Review presentations.
As a land-locked, mountainous and least developed country emerging from conflict, and from the devastating earthquakes, Nepal understands that its journey towards achieving Sustainable Development Goals is full of challenges.
Yet, we in Nepal are committed not to be left behind in this journey. That brings us here to share our unique experience, including successes, challenges and lessons learned, with a view to accelerate the implementation of the 2030 Agenda in the country.
On behalf of the Government of Nepal, I have the honour to present Nepal’s VNRtoday.
Nepal’s Voluntary National Review comes through a rigorous consultation process.Over a period of six months, Government institutions,national stakeholders including the private sector, academia and civil society were involved in the preparation of the national report.
Mr. President,
Inpast few decades, our development endeavor has yielded some good progressin socio-economic front. The achievements in the education and health sectors, in particular, have been impressive.
Similarly, the character of slow pace of growth has begun to see a positive change.
After a gap of several years, the country’s economy is expected to grow by7 percentin Fiscal Year 2016-17. Thiscould mark the beginning of a key turnaround for Nepal.
Building on the achievements so far, Nepal desires to swiftly complete the unfinished agenda of the MDGs, and step up its efforts towards realizing the SDGs. This objective perfectly fits into Nepal’s aspiration become a middle income country by 2030.
However, the road is full of multiple constraints- the constraints of resource, capacity, and technology. We are yet to attain the level of meeting required income criterion for the graduation.
The need is to forge real and meaningful partnership among all stakeholders to achieve the SDGs. A partnership that not only deliberates, but also delivers.
Our pursuit of development through the SDGs framework is testified by the fact that Nepal was among the first few countries to produce a preliminary SDGsReport in 2015, even before the formal adoption of the 2030 Agenda.
In collaboration with key development stakeholders, Nepal has set the country-specific SDG-related targets to be achieved by 2030. We have mainstreamed the 2030 Agenda into our national plans and policies. The 14th periodic plan, the national budget, and other sectoral plans have been closely aligned with the SDGs.
The 17 SDGs have been mapped into the five strategies of the 14th development plan. They are infrastructure development, economic prosperity, social development, governance and crosscutting issues. A total of 1,219 programs and projects are being implemented in the current fiscal year.
SDG codes have been assigned to all these annual programs in the national budget. Expenditure tracking methods have also been introduced.
We have put into implementation several programs aligning with those goals and targets; and have put concerted efforts to bring results out of them. Some of them have started yielding promising results.
Mr. President,
The Constitutionof Nepal promulgated by the widely representative elected Constituent Assembly in 2015 is an embodiment of inclusive, participatory and rights-based development. It serves as the guiding light for development policies, plans and programs of the country.
The directive principles, policies and responsibilities of the state enshrined in the Constitution include all the three dimensions of SDGs – Social, Economic and Environmental.
Nepal’s achievements in gender equality have been inspiring. The Constitution guarantees at least one-third representation of women in the Federal Parliament as well as the Provincial Assemblies.
The recent elections to the local bodies has ensured close to a half of women’s participation. Either Speaker or Deputy Speaker of both the houses of parliament must be a woman. The President and Vice-President of the country should represent different sex or community. Currently we have 30% of women’s representation in the Parliament.
We achieved the goal of gender and child health related MDGs reflected in gender parity in schooling, greater share of women in civil service and in the ownership of properties. By 2030, we expect that women in civil service and public decision-making positions will increase by four-folds.
Nepal has halved extreme poverty in the past 15 years, and is on track to confine it to less than 5 percent by 2030. Weaspire to reduce undernourishment to 3 percent and underweight in children less than five years of age to 5 percent.
Our target is to reduce the maternal mortality rate to less than 70 per 100,000 live births. Other targets include virtual elimination of the prevalence of HIV, TB, Malaria, and other tropical and water borne diseases.
Similarly, the commitment and efforts of Nepal to create gender parity at all levels of education have been largely successful. Our goal is to eliminate the wage discrimination, sexual violence and all harmful social practices, such as child marriage.
Nepal targets to increase the road density to 1.5 km per square km and paved road density to 0.25 km per square km. We will connect all municipalities and village councils to the national road network.
Our target is to increase the share of employment by the industrial sector to 25 percent, with the manufacturing sub-sector itself providing 13 percent of the employment opportunities.
As envisioned by the SDGs, Nepal anticipates that all stakeholders will walk in tandem throughout the implementation phase by adhering in true spirit the notion of resource mobilization and capacity building as shared responsibility and accountability.
Mr. President,
We have accorded high priority to the implementation of SDGs.
Three high-level committees have been formed to help implement them. At the apex is the Steering Committee chaired by the Prime Minister himself which demonstrates the highest political commitment.
A Coordination Committee chaired by the Vice Chairman of the National Planning Commission (NPC) and nine Thematic Committees headed by the Members of the Planning Commission are inclusive in terms of representation of the public and private sectors, as well as civil society and other national stakeholders.
Effective financing strategies becomecrucial for Nepal to achieve the 2030 goals. The Constitution of Nepal has envisioned complementary mobilization of resources from public, private and cooperative sectors for financing the socio-economic development efforts.
We have witnessed a sound progress in Nepal’s revenue mobilization in recent times.Despite this, it is vulnerable to likely swings in the large volumes of inward remittances, which bolster import-based taxation. The aim is to increase the share of revenue from about 22 percent of GDP today to 30 per cent by 2030. Domestic expenditures financed by revenue are estimated to reach 80 percent. In order to meet the private sector investment-financing gap, foreign direct investment  is expected to increase to 20 percent of GDP by 2030, from less than 3 percent in 2015.
The Government is preparing a document Envisioning Nepal 2030.The 2015 SDGs Preliminary Report is being upgraded to a Base Line Report, and at the same time, the investment requirements to achieve SDGs and implementation strategies are being finalized.
Mr. President,
Let me now briefly highlight the challenges before us.
The SDGs are interlinked, indivisible, and ambitious and thus, pose major implementation challenges for low-income countries like Nepal.
As the country embarks on implementing a new federal structure of governance, a prominent challenge will be to quickly mainstream SDGs into the provincial and local level planning and budgeting systems. Inadequate database and lack of disaggregated data by sex, age, social groups, disability status, geography, income and sub-national level will hinder the monitoring of progress.
Apart from the challenges related to the realignment of policies, financing challenges will loom large. Triggering and sustaining job-creating economic growth, enhancing the quality of social service provisioning and ensuring adequate investment to reduce the risks from disasters will be a major hurdle for Nepal to successfully implement the SDGs.
The positive lessons learned from the MDG-era would be invaluable for Nepal as it embarks on an ambitious journey ahead. The coordinated resource mobilization mechanism has helped usproduce impressive results in health, education, water and sanitation sectors. While the triangular partnership between the government, private sector and development partners has proved effective in some other fronts. This needs to be augmented significantly if Nepal is to spur reforms that attract substantial private capital and entrepreneurship.
Before I conclude, I would like to take a balcony view of the global strides towards the 2030 agenda. Although the perceived success of MDGs did provide us the ground for elevating social, economic and environmental dimensions into a single broader goal –namely, the SDGs – achieving this is not easy.
We must realize that SDGs are combinations of extraordinary ambition that requires consistent political commitment and the ability to mobilize political and economic actors and the resources.
There is a need of installing a strong mechanism to oversee the progress at international and intergovernmental level, and further strengthen the current review and follow-up mechanism. In this regard, we believe a comprehensive matrix would be instrumental to review progress on all the Goals and targets with a view to facilitating feedback and corrective measures.
Mobilization of political will at national level, forging strong partnership at regional and international levels would be crucial for achieving SDGs.
It is an ambitious and arduous journey. However, it is a journey worth pursuing. Joined together, this journey will lead us to the goal that we all aspired for.
I thank you all.

Workshop on Nepal-India Trade, Transit and Connectivity
 Vishakhapatnam, July 12, 2017
Opening remarks by H. E. Mr. Deep Kumar Upadhyaya, Ambassador of Nepal to India
 
Thank you very much for joining us for this important workshop on the topical themes of trade, transit and connectivity.
Some of you have traveled a long way from Nepal and some of you from different parts of India to attend this event and contribute to the discussion. We are thankful for your dedication of time and wisdom. We are also thankful to IDSA for helping us to make this event possible.
The Embassy of Nepal and IDSA are jointly organizing this programme as a part of the Embassy’s economic diplomacy initiative. We have chosen this smart and growing city as the event venue in the context of the important bilateral agreement last year regarding the use of Visakhapatnam Port by Nepal. As our traders are keenly assessing how they can make the best and most beneficial use of the highly modern port facilities available at Visakhapatnam for transit, it is logical that we choose the city to hold this discussion on trade and transit issues.
We all are aware that trade, transit and connectivity constitute vital components of Nepal-India bilateral relations. India is not only our biggest trading partner but also the main transit country for our third country export and import.
Twenty years back, trade with India accounted for only a third of Nepal’s total foreign trade whereas the proportion has now increased to almost two third. Our trade linkage with India has increased both in volume and proportion.
As good as the growth in trade volume is, growing trade deficit with India has been a matter of serious concern for us over the years. How can Nepal bridge up this unsustainable gap between what it exports and what it imports? How can we expand our trade base particularly export trade? Does our bilateral trade treaty require a review, particularly in the context of the evolving arrangement under SAFTA in order to ensure that exports from Nepal would receive a more facilitative treatment than what is already there in SAFTA? Or the operational and administrative aspects on the ground are more critical for trade facilitation than the treaty itself? How do we address the issues of non-tariff barriers? Now that India has embarked on the implementation of tax reform in the form of GST, what will be its implications on bilateral trade? These are the key trade related questions that we expect to deliberate on and receive insightful feedback from expert panels in the 4 thematic sessions scheduled for today.
Trade and transit relation between Nepal and India is not a new phenomenon. Just like other components of our relations, economic engagement between our peoples has a long history.Exchange of goods and services was an indispensible part of the regular chores of our people. Long back, Nepal was one of the major entrepots of trade and transit in the whole region.
What we have done in the modern days is build upon the long held traditional economic interaction and convert it into a rule-based system. As a result, we have today an elaborate arrangement of treaties, protocols, agreements and MoUs of varying scope, content and character. One of the objectives of this programme is to have a review of the existing trade and transit related instruments applicable between us and see where improvements can be made in order to further strengthen the economic component of Nepal-India relations. We all know that in today’s globalized world, economic progress counts more than any other national pursuits.
Cross border infrastructure and state-of-the-art connectivity means are the sine qua non of strong economic engagement and this is the area that did not receive adequate focus and commitment in the past. Where geography is easy, time and cost of building highways and railways are less. We did not adequately cash on this gift of geography for years in order to build up better connectivity.
There are at least a dozen points in the proximity of Nepal-India international border, for example, where Indian railway heads reached decades ago. Long before, we could have extended railways by some more kilometers to reach Nepal and sped up trade, transit, flow of tourists and movements of common people in all those points.
Better late than never. We are implementing cross border railway projects at two principal border points and three more such cross border railway projects are in pipeline. Just a few months back the announcement by Hon’ble Railway Minister of India about linking Kathmandu with Indian railways turned out to be welcome news in Nepal. We hope for the early concretization of the project.
Our roads are turning out to be better on both sides. However, in most of these places, cross border roads still pass through the bottlenecks of crowded marketplace and our trucks wait for hours to cross these crowded stretch of a few kilometers — sometimes ridiculously longer than the time they spend to ply for miles over the newly built highways. Both governments as well as other stakeholders on both sides are cognizant of the situation and we have started to upgrade infrastructure. What is required is some more speed in the implementation of projects like ICPs and the roads linking the national highways on both sides.
So, in various sessions today, we will reflect on the normative as well as operational aspects of trade, transit and connectivity between Nepal and India. Deliberations here will provide valuable inputs for how our two governments and other stakeholders seek to engage in these areas in future.
I thank you once again for sparing your time and look forward to insightful discussion.
Thank you.

Keynote speech by the Rt. Hon’ble Vice President Mr. Nanda Bahadur Pun in the Opening Ceremony and High-end Forum for Cooperation and Development along the Silk Road
 Lanzhou, 6 July 2017
 
His Excellency Mr. Qi Xuchun, Vice Chairman of the CPPCC
His Excellency Mr. Lin Duo, Party Secretary of Gansu Province
Excellencies
Distinguished Participants
Ladies and Gentlemen
 
It gives me immense pleasure to be amidst you today in the Opening Ceremony of 23rd China-Lanzhou Investment and Trade Fair and High-end Forum for Cooperation and Development along the Silk Road.
Taking this opportunity, I thank the Government of the People’s Republic of China and Gansu Provincial People’s Government for excellent arrangements made and warm hospitality extended to me and my delegation since our arrival in this historic and beautiful city of Lanzhou.
Our two countries are both old friends and close friends. We have long history of harmonious and friendly relations. Our political relations are cordial and are based on the unshakable foundations of peaceful coexistence- the Panchasheel. Nepal adheres to One China policy and does not allow its soil to be used by any inimical activity against China. Nepal appreciates China’s continued respect for Nepal’s sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity.
Gansu province is not only the part of the ancient silk route; it is also one of the important commercial and transportation hubs of Western China. Nepal shares historic linkages with this Province. The establishment of sister city relationship between Kathmandu City and Lanzhou City last year has also added a new dimension in bringing our people closer.
We have a tradition of exchanging high-level visits to further the bilateral cooperation between the two countries. In line with this, the then Prime Minister Hon’ble Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’, after attending the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Session, had a very fruitful meeting with the Chinese President His Excellency Xi Jinping in Beijing this March. Nepal is fully committed to implement all the agreements reached in the past between the two countries.
We thank and appreciate the people and Government of China for their spontaneous and valuable support extended to Nepal after the devastating earthquakes of 2015 and for their pledge of 3 billion RMB for the reconstruction projects for the period of 2016-18.
In the context of successful conclusion of Belt and Road (B&R) Forum for International Cooperation in last May in Beijing, the theme chosen as “Cooperation and Development along the Silk Road” is pertinent.
Since the concept -Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) was propounded in 2013 by the Chinese President His Excellency Xi Jinping, it has achieved a good progress and has got new momentum after the B&R Forum. It is our belief that the BRI would be instrumental to pursue the agenda of our common priority. We are happy to note that BRI is based on the spirit of peace, cooperation, openness, inclusiveness, mutual learning and mutual benefits.
BRI aims at promoting connectivity and unleashing the potentials in trade, investment, tourism, people-to-people ties and other similar areas of our common interest. Such cooperation would entail the rapid economic growth and socio-economic development in order to contribute our aspiration of common prosperity.
For all these, we need more interconnected world, not the fragmented one. Mutually beneficial cooperation among countries is possible only when our cities are connected by rails, roads and airways; our peoples have regular interactions and our bilateral mechanisms functions properly. This would bring about real changes in terms of our trade and investment landscape.
In the case of LDCs and LLDCs countries like Nepal, it is our conviction that the economic bottlenecks and infrastructures deficits require to overcome without further delay. In this context, we have taken the BRI as an opportunity for the development of infrastructures and improvements of connectivity between Nepal and China for mutual benefits. These efforts would unleash the potentials of trade, investment, tourism, people-level contacts, among others. Nepal wishes improve cross-border connectivity and utilize the natural resources for the economic transformation of our people. Economic transformation of country like Nepal is possible only with more capital investment, transfer of technology, long term cooperation with BRI countries and sharing of experiences for common benefit.
It is our understanding that China has been making timely efforts to provide much needed stimulus for infrastructure development for realizing potentials of other segments of the economy in Asia and beyond. This requires collaboration, partnership and joint efforts as mentioned in Confucian analects- “One who wishes himself to be successful must also help others to be successful; one who wishes to develop himself must also help other to develop.”
Recently, we have achieved significant political gains and making impressive headway towards economic transformation. The latest World Banks report projects Nepal as the third fastest growing economy in the world for this year. We have taken several reforms measures to provide conducive environment for investment in our priority sectors. Hydro-power and tourism are among them. We need huge investment in infrastructure and tourism industry and publicity of the tourism resources such as the Mount Everest, the Himalayas, the Lumbini- Birthplace of Shakyamuni Buddha in the potential source markets like China.
Nepal is the founding member of the AIIB. We also hold the dialogue partner status in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. Together with our active participation in SAARC, BIMSTEC and UN, we should effectively pursue the agenda of development in all forums. We are fully confident that the BRI will also bring prosperity and development in the region and beyond.
Ladies and Gentlemen, 
We thank and appreciate China for its continued support and cooperation to the socio-economic development efforts of Nepal. We appreciate the Chinese Government for its announcement to mark the 2017 as ‘Nepal Tourism Promotion Year in China’. Nepal is committed to realize the potential of this initiative with concerted efforts of all stakeholders. We believe that the Government of China could also support and cooperate to make the year successful by encouraging more Chinese people to visit Nepal.
The promulgation of Constitution, concluding stage of peace process and successful holding of two phases of local level elections are major political achievements of Nepal in the recent past. Our next agenda is socio-economic transformation of the country. We need huge investment for maximum utilization of our natural resources for bringing prosperity in Nepal. In this context, I would like to state here that Nepal is a safe for investment. Our legal frameworks are conducive for the investor with guarantee for repatriation of return on investment. In the Nepal Investment Summit held in March this year, out of total 13.5 billion US Dollar investment intents, 8.3 billion US Dollar came only from the Chinese companies. We are encouraged by their intent to invest in Nepal. The Government is committed to materialize the pledge for investment in Nepal.
Taking this opportunity, I invite the investors, entrepreneurs and businesspersons from all across China and particularly from Gansu and other neighboring provinces as well as from the participating countries of the BRI to seize the opportunities available in Nepal.
Finally, I am fully confident that the deliberation in this Forum would provide opportunity to share ideas and visions to push forward the spirit of development and cooperation as espoused in the BRI.
I wish the Forum all success!
Thank you very much!

सम्माननीय राष्ट्रपति श्रीमती विद्यादेवी भण्डारीज्यूबाट श्रमसम्बन्धी शीखर सम्मेलनमा भएको सम्बोधन
अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय श्रम सम्मेलनको १०६ औँ सत्र
बिहीबार, १५ जुन २०१७
 
अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय श्रम सम्मेलनका अध्यक्ष महोदय,
मित्र राष्ट्र माल्टा एवं मौरिससका सम्माननीय राष्ट्रप्रमुखज्यूहरू,
अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय श्रम संगठनका महानिर्देशक श्री गाइ राइडर,
अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय श्रम संगठनमा सरकार, रोजगारदाता र श्रमिक प्रतिनिधित्व गर्ने विशिष्ट प्रतिनिधिहरू,
श्रम जगतका प्रतिष्ठित व्यक्तित्वहरू,
भद्र महिला तथा सज्जनवृन्द,
 
१.सर्वप्रथम यस महत्त्वपूर्ण सम्मेलनमा निमन्त्रणा गर्नुभएकोमा तथा सम्मेलनको उत्कृष्ट व्यवस्थापनको लागि अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय श्रम संगठनका महानिर्देशक श्री गाइ राइडरलाई हार्दिक धन्यवाद ज्ञापन गर्न चाहन्छु ।
२. अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय श्रम सम्मेलनको १०६ औँ सत्रको अभिन्न अंगको रूपमा आयोजना गरिएको यो गरिमामय शिखर सम्मेलनमा गणतन्त्र नेपालको पहिलो महिला राष्ट्रपतिका रुपमा नेपाल र नेपाली जनतालाई प्रतिनिधित्व गर्दै भाग लिन पाउँदा अत्यन्त गौरवान्वित महसूस गरेको छु ।
३.नेपाली जनताको अनवरत सङ्घर्ष एवं बलिदानबाट मुलुकले हासिल गरेको ऐतिहासिक राजनीतिक उपलब्धीको पृष्ठभूमिमा यो मञ्चमा उपस्थित भएर विशिष्ट महानुभावहरूका अगाडि नेपालको अनुभव प्रस्तुत गर्न पाउँदा सिङ्गो राष्ट्र नै सम्मानित भएको अनुभूति गरेको छु ।
४.द्वन्द्वको अवस्थाबाट शान्तिपूर्ण राजनीतिक रूपान्तरणका साथसाथै पुरातन र रूढिवादी सामाजिक संरचनामा समेत आमूल परिवर्तन ल्याउन नेपालले गरेको प्रयास विश्व समुदायले अभिरुचिका साथ हेरिरहेको हामीले पाएका छौँ। सामाजिक रूपान्तरणको दिशामा हाम्रो यात्रा जारी छ ।
५.मैले यहाँहरू सबैलाईविश्व शान्तिका अग्रदूत गौतम बुद्ध र विश्वको सर्वोच्च शिखर सगरमाथाको भूमि नेपाल, नेपाली परिश्रमी जनतार नेपाल सरकार तर्फबाट न्यानो अभिवादन र शुभकामना ल्याएको छु ।
६.यस सम्मेलनलाई सम्वोधन गरिरहँदा श्रमको संसारलाई मर्यादित, समतापूर्ण र सामाजिक रूपमा न्यायसम्मत बनाउन अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय श्रम संगठनले पुर्‍याएको विशिष्ट योगदानप्रति नेपालको तर्फबाट हार्दिक आभार प्रकट गर्न चाहन्छु ।
७.आगामी २०१९ मा अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय श्रम संगठनको १०० औँ वार्षिकोत्सव नजिकिँदै गरेको सन्दर्भमा यस संगठनले “श्रममा महिला” विषयलाई पनि आफ्ना शताब्दी पहलहरूमा स्थान दिएकोमा उच्च प्रशंसा गर्दछु।
८. हालै सम्पन्न निर्वाचनमा नेपाललाई गभर्निङ्ग बोर्डमा निर्वाचित गरी सेवा गर्ने अवसर दिनुभएकोमा म सम्पूर्ण सदस्य राष्ट्रहरूप्रति हार्दिक आभार प्रकट गर्दछु ।
भद्र महिला तथा सज्जनवृन्द,
९. सामन्जस्यपूर्ण औद्योगिक सम्बन्ध र औद्योगिक शान्ति कायम गर्नमा ट्रेड यूनियनहरूले खेलेको भूमिकाले अन्ततः समाजकै आर्थिक विकास र समृद्धिका लागि योगदान पुगेको छ । नेपालमा पनि राजनीतिक रुपान्तरणमा ट्रेड यूनियनको भूमिका महत्वपूर्ण रहेको छ ।
१०. अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय श्रम संगठनले प्रवर्द्धन गरेको “मर्यादितश्रमकोएजेन्डा”न्यायपूर्णविश्वव्यापीकरणकोमूलतत्वहो, जसले यो प्रक्रियामा सबको जीत सुनिश्चित गर्न सक्दछ । हरेक मुलुकले श्रमलाई उचित सम्मान र मूल्य दिने हो भने यो लक्ष प्राप्त गर्न सम्भव छ । श्रमलाई मर्यादित बनाउन असल अभ्यासहरूबाट सिक्ने र नवीन विचारहरूलाई प्रष्फुटन हुन दिने वातावरण पनि सिर्जना गरिनु पर्दछ ।
११. सन् २०१५ मा विश्वभरीका राजनेताहरूले उच्च लक्ष्यका साथ दिगो विकाससम्बन्धी २०३० एजेण्डालाई स्वीकार गर्नुभएको छ ।मर्यादित श्रमका सबै स्तम्भहरूलाई उक्तएजेण्डामा उचित महत्त्व दिइएकोमा मलाई सन्तोष लागेको छ । साथै,सोएजेण्डाले लैंगिक समानतालाई आफ्नो उद्देश्य र लक्ष्यमा पुग्ने एक महत्वपूर्ण आधारको रूपमा सही किसिमले पहिचान गरेको छ ।
महामहिमहरू,
१२. केहि दशक अघिको तुलनामा अवश्य पनि अहिले महिलाहरू बढी शिक्षित र तालिमप्राप्त छन्, श्रम बजारमा पहुँच तथा संसदमा प्रतिनिधित्व बढेको छ, सरकार र उद्यमको नेतृत्व तहमा धेरै महिलाहरू पुगेका छन् । तर पनि लैंगिक समानताको हाम्रो लक्ष्य पूर्णरुपमा अझै प्राप्त भएको छैन । भेदभाव र असमानताको जगमा समाज सँधैभरी अडिरहन सक्दैन । महिला विरुद्धको भेदभावको अन्त्य हुनैपर्दछ । यसका लागि हामी सबैले सार्थक प्रयास गर्नै पर्दछ ।
१३. दशकौंको प्रयासका बावजूद अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय प्रतिबद्धताको कार्यान्वयन पक्ष कमजोर रहेको छ  । श्रमको संसारमा महिलाहरूको प्रगति अझै पनि सुस्त र व्यवधानपूर्ण छ । महिला क्षमताको न्यून उपयोगको अवस्था विद्यमान रहेको छ ।
१४. साँचो कुरा के हो भने राजनीतिक, आर्थिक, सामाजिक र साँस्कृतिक रूपमा महिलाहरूको सशक्तीकरण नभएसम्म समतामूलक, न्यायोचित र शान्तिपूर्ण समाजको परिकल्पना गर्न सकिँदैन । यो मर्मलाई हामीले आत्मसात गर्नै पर्दछ ।
१५.श्रमको संसारका महिलाबारे बोल्दा आप्रवासी महिला कामदार र तिनीहरूमाथि हुने गरेको शोषणको आर्तनादले म झनै मर्माहत हुने गरेको छु । विभिन्न स्वरूपमा निकृष्ट श्रमको निरन्तरता हुनु र महिला तथा बालबालिका बेचबिखनको रूपमा आधुनिक दाशता प्रकट हुनु मानव सभ्यताको कलङ्क हो । यो अवस्था कदापि रहनु हुँदैन ।
१६. मेरो राजनीतिक यात्राको दौरान विद्यार्थी, महिला नेता तथा श्रमिक अभियन्ताको रूपमा धेरै अवरोधहरूलाई मैले नजीकबाट देखेको छु । पितृसत्तात्मक समाजमा महिलालाई राजनीतिक नेतृत्वसम्म पुग्न कति कठिन र चुनौतिपूर्ण छ भन्ने म स्वयंले भोगेको छु । तथापि मेरो राजनीतिक यात्रामा यहाँसम्म आइपुग्दा मैले पराजयको अनुभव भने गर्नुपरेको छैन । दह्रो प्रतिवद्धता र अविचलित प्रयासबाट कठिनतम राजनीतिक परीक्षामा महिलाहरू सफल हुन सक्छन् भन्ने सन्देश यसबाट सिक्न सकिन्छ ।
महामहिमहरू,
१७. कमजोर अर्थतन्त्र र लामो सङ्क्रमण लगायत विभिन्न सीमितता र चुनौतीहरूका बावजूद श्रम संसार होस् वा सामाजिक, आर्थिक र राजनीतिक संरचनाहरू हुन् सबै क्षेत्रमा नेपालले लैंगिक समानता हासिल गर्ने दिशामा महत्वपूर्ण प्रगति गरेको कुरा यहाँहरूसमक्ष राख्न पाउँदा मलाई अत्यन्त हर्ष लागेको छ ।तर यी उपलब्धिहरू केवल संयोगवश प्राप्त भएका भने होइनन् ।
१८.सतिप्रथा, बालविवाह, बहुविवाह, दाइजो, सामाजिक बहिष्करण र बञ्चितीकरणको कहालीलाग्दो अवस्थाबाट आजको स्थितिमा आइपुग्नको पछाडि लामो सङ्घर्षपूर्ण पृष्ठभूमि रहेको छ । यसका लागि हाम्रा थुप्रै अग्रज महिला र छोरीचेलीहरूले पर्याप्त रगत पसिना बगाएका छन् ।कैयौँले शहादत समेत प्राप्त गरेका छन् ।
१९. विषम परिस्थितिमा पनि कुशासन र कुरीति विरुद्ध सतसट्ठीजना अनुयायीका साथ वि.सं. १९९८ मा पूर्वी नेपालको अरुण नदीमा जलसमाधी लिनुहुने योगमाया न्यौपानेको अदम्य साहसलाई म यस अवसरमा स्मरण गर्न चाहन्छु । वहाँ नेपाली महिला आन्दोलनको अग्रणी प्रेरणाश्रोत हुनुहुन्छ । नेपालको युगान्तकारीराजनीतिक तथा सामाजिक रुपान्तरणको यात्रा विभिन्न क्षेत्रका यस्ता थुप्रै जुझारु महिलाहरूको योगदानको गाथाले भरिपूर्ण छ । म ती सबै महिलाहरूप्रति उच्च सम्मान प्रकट गर्दछु।
महिला तथा सज्जनवृन्द,
२०. झन्डै सात दशकको अनवरत संघर्ष पछि २०७२ साल असोज ३ गते नेपाली जनताले आफूले चुनेका प्रतिनिधिहरूमार्फत आफ्नो संविधान निर्माण गरे ।
२१. नेपालको संविधान विभेद र उत्पीडनको अन्त्य गरी समानता, सामाजिक न्याय, समानुपातिक समावेशी सिद्धान्तमा आधारित समतामूलक समाज निर्माण गर्ने आदर्शमा स्थापित रहेको छ ।संविधानले विभेदरहित समाजको परिकल्पना गरेको छ र नागरिकको लागि प्रत्याभूत गरिएका कतिपय अधिकारहरू तुलनात्मक रूपमा उच्चकोटीका रहेका छन् ।
२२. संविधानले लैंगिक भेदभाव विना समान वंशीय हक, हिंसाजन्य कार्य वा शोषणविरुद्धको हक, शिक्षा, स्वास्थ्य, रोजगारी र सामाजिक सुरक्षामा सकारात्मक विभेदका आधारमा विशेष अवसरजस्ता महिला लक्षित विशिष्ट अधिकारहरू प्रदान गरेको छ ।
२३. लिङ्गको आधारमा कुनै पनि पेशा वा रोजगारीमा प्रवेश गर्न अवरोध छैन । निजामती, जङ्गी तथा अन्य सुरक्षा निकायका पदहरूमा महिलाहरू समान अधिकारका हकदार छन् । संयुक्त राष्ट्र सङ्घको आह्वानमा विश्वका विभिन्न भागमा शान्ति स्थापनार्थ खटिने टोलीमा नेपाली महिलाहरूको सहभागिता बढिरहेको छ । तलब तथा अन्य सुविधामा लैंगिक विभेद पूर्णरूपले निषेध गरिएको छ ।बरु महिलालाई जोखिमपूर्ण काममा लगाउन प्रतिवन्ध लगाइएको छ ।
२४.महिलाहरूलाई थप सशक्तीकरण गर्नसरकारी तथा सार्वजनिक क्षेत्रमा सकारात्मक विभेदको कानूनी व्यवस्था कार्यान्वयन भइरहेको छ । निजामती सेवामा आरक्षित सिटमध्ये ३३ प्रतिशत स्थान महिलाका लागि सुनिश्चित गरिएको छ । यसको परिणामस्वरूप, सार्वजनिक प्रशासनको निर्णय प्रक्रियामा महिलाको प्रतिनिधित्व उल्लेख्य रूपमा बढेको छ भने क्रमशः उनीहरू नेतृत्व तहसम्म पुग्नसक्ने मार्ग प्रशस्त समेत भएको छ ।
भद्र महिला तथा सज्जनवृन्द,
२५. राजनीतिक तहमा महिलाको प्रतिनिधित्व सुनिश्चित गर्न अग्रगामी सोचका साथ समावेशी सिद्धान्त अवलम्बन गरिएको छ । यी प्रावधानहरू केवल भनाइमा मात्रै सीमित रहेका छैनन् ।
२6. आज नेपालको राष्ट्रप्रमुख र व्यवस्थापिका संसदको सभामुख महिला भएको जानकारी गराउंदा मलाई गर्व लागेको छ । गत हप्ता सेवानिवृत्त हुनुअघिसम्म सर्वोच्च अदालतका प्रधान न्यायाधीश पनि महिला नै हुनुहुन्थ्यो।
२७. हाम्रो संसदमा महिला सांसदको संख्या पहिले नै एकतिहाई छँदैछ । राष्ट्रपति र उपराष्ट्रपतिको निर्वाचन फरक फरक लिंग वा समुदायको प्रतिनिधित्व हुने गरी गर्नु पर्ने र संसदका दुवै सदनमा सभामुख र उपसभामुखमध्ये एकजना महिला हुनुपर्ने संवैधानिक व्यवस्था रहेको छ ।
२८.यस उपलब्धीको पछाडि रहेको एउटा महत्त्वपूर्ण दृष्टान्त प्रस्तुत गर्न चाहन्छु । २०६२ / ६३ को जनआन्दोलन पछी पुनर्स्थापित प्रतिनिधिसभामा राज्यका सबै निकायमा एकतिहाइ महिला सहभागिता अनिवार्य गराउने संकल्प प्रस्तावको प्रस्तावक हुने सौभाग्य मैले पाएँ । लामो यात्राको शुरुवात एक कदमबाट हुन्छ भन्ने भनाइमा सत्यता छ भन्ने मलाई लाग्छ ।
२९. स्थानीय तहसम्म नै महिलाको समानुपातिक समावेशी सहभागिता सुनिश्चित गरिएको छ । हालै सम्पन्न स्थानीय तहको प्रथम चरणको निर्वाचनले महिलाहरूको राजनीतिक प्रतिनिधित्वमा उल्लेख्य वृद्धि गरेको छ ।
३०.अबको दुई हप्तामा हुन गैरहेको दोस्रो चरणको निर्वाचनले स्थानीय तहमा कम्तिमा ४० प्रतिशत महिला प्रतिनिधित्व हुनुपर्ने अनिवार्य संवैधानिक व्यवस्थालाई साकार तुल्याउनेछ ।त्यस्तै स्थानिय तह गाउँपालिका र नगरपालिकाको प्रमुख वा उपप्रमुखमध्ये एक पदमा महिलाले उमेद्वारी प्राप्त गर्ने व्यवस्थाभएको ले अबस्थानीय तहको नेतृत्वमा महिला र पुरुषको बराबर प्रतिनिधित्व हुनेछ ।
३१. महिलाको हक हितसँग सम्बन्धित संवैधानिक एवं कानूनी प्रावधान र नेपाल राज्य पक्ष भएको अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय सन्धि सम्झौताअन्तर्गतका दायित्वको पालन भए नभएको अनुगमन गर्ने अधिकारसहित एउटा स्वतन्त्र राष्ट्रिय महिला आयोगको गठन भएको छ ।
३२. संविधानको व्यवस्था बमोजिम आगामी दिनमा सम्पन्न हुने प्रादेशिक र संघीय संसद्को निर्वाचनले हाम्रो सामाजिक र लैंगिक विविधताको झल्कोलाई राष्ट्रिय राजनीतिमा पूर्णतः प्रतिबिम्वित गर्नेछ।
३३. हामीले अवलम्बन गरेको यो महिलाको राजनीतिक प्रतिनिधित्वको व्यवस्था धेरै मुलुकहरूका लागि अनुकरणीय हुन सक्छ भन्ने ठानेको छु ।
महामहिमहरू,
३४. अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय श्रम संगठनका आठ मुख्य महासन्धिहरूमध्ये सात वटामा पक्षराष्ट्र रहेको नेपालको संविधानले रोजगारीको हक, श्रमको हक, सामाजिक न्यायको हकसहित ट्रेड युनियन खोल्ने, त्यसमा सहभागी हुने तथा सामूहिक सौदाबाजी गर्न पाउने अधिकारलाई आत्मसात गरेको छ ।
३५. सन् २०१५ मा नेपाल सरकारद्वारा जारी राष्ट्रिय रोजगार नीतिले लैंगिक तथा सामाजिक समावेशी नीतिलाई मूलप्रवाहीकरण गरेको छ । सरकारले लैङ्गिक बजेटको व्यवस्था गरी लैङ्गिक समानता कायम गर्ने कार्यक्रमहरूमा वित्तीय स्रोतको सुनिश्चितता गरेको छ । राष्ट्रपति महिला उत्थान कार्यक्रममार्फत यो एजेण्डालाई उच्च राजनीतिक प्रतिवद्धताका साथ राष्ट्रिय प्राथमिकतामा राखिएको छ ।
३६. श्रम बजारमा लैंगिक समानतासम्बन्धी हाम्रो उपलब्धिलाई हालैका केहि तथ्याङ्कले समेत पुष्टि गर्दछन् ।
३७. दक्षिण एशियामा नेपालको महिला श्रम सहभागिताको दर उच्चतम रहेको छ भने विश्वव्यापी रूपमा हामी १७ ‌औँ स्थानमा रहेका छौं ।
३८. बीस वर्षअघि श्रम बजारमा महिलाहरूको सहभागिता छैसट्ठी प्रतिशतको हाराहारीमा थियो भने २०१५ मा आएर यो सहभागिता असी प्रतिशतभन्दा बढी पुगेको छ ।
३९. श्रममा महिलाको उपस्थिति अझ सुरक्षित, लैङ्गिकमैत्री तथा समतामूलक बनाउन हामीले आवश्यक नीतिहरू तथा कानूनी संरचनाको व्यवस्था गरेका छौँ र भैरहेका कानूनी संरचनाहरूलाई क्रमिकरूपमा परिमार्जन र सुधार गरिआएका छौँ ।
४०. महिलाको आर्थिक सशक्तीकरणका सन्दर्भमा अर्को एक दृष्टान्त प्रस्तुत गर्न चाहन्छु । हामीले महिलालाई जमिनको स्वामित्व दिलाउन एउटा प्रयोग गर्‍यौँ। जतिखेर भूमिमाथि महिलाको स्वामित्व ८ प्रतिशत मात्रै थियो त्यही समय म आफूसमेत रहेको मन्त्रिपरिषदबाट महिलाको नाममा जग्गा रजिष्ट्रेशन गरेमा दस्तूरमा छुट दिने नीति जारी भयो । परिणामतः महिलाको भू–स्वामित्व एक वर्षमै २६ प्रतिशत पुग्यो ।
महिला तथा सज्जनवृन्द,
४१. लैङ्गिक सवालसँग सम्बन्धित सहश्राब्दी विकास लक्ष्यमा नेपालले गरेको प्रगतिले हामीलाई भविष्यप्रति आशावादी बनाएको छ । साक्षरता, विद्यालय भर्ना दर, मातृ स्वास्थ्य, मातृ मृत्यूदर, महिला सशक्तीकरण तथा राजनीतिक सहभागिताका समग्र आयाममा सन्तोषजनक प्रगति हासिल भएको छ । माध्यमिक शिक्षामा महिला भर्नादरको विश्वव्यापी सूचकाङ्कमा हामी पहिलो रहेका छौँ भन्न पाउंदा मलाई सन्तोष लागेको छ ।
४२. महिला सशक्तीकरणका मुद्दाहरूलाई सम्बोधन गर्न हामीले गरेका समग्र प्रयासहरूले आर्थिक क्रियाकलापमा महिला सहभागिताको गतिशील स्थान निर्माण भएको छ । महिलाहरूकै पहल र नेतृत्वमा सञ्चालित उद्यमहरूको उल्लेख्य वृद्धि भएको पाएका छौँ ।
४३. नीतिगत तथा व्यावहारिक पक्षमा गरिएका सुधारको फलस्वरुप आर्थिक संरचनामा उद्यमी एवं श्रमिक दुवै रुपमा महिलाहरूको सहभागिता अभिवृद्धि भएको छ।
४४. विभिन्न प्रगतिका वाबजूद महिलाहरूको सन्दर्भमा आर्थिक संरचना एवं श्रम बजारलाई समतामूलक बनाउन हामीले थप प्रयास गर्नुपर्ने अवस्था रहेको छ।
४५. चुनौतिहरू सबैतिर छन् । महिलाहरूले गर्ने अवैतनिक घरेलु श्रमको गणना अर्थतन्त्रमा अद्यापि हुन सकेको छैन । बजारमा मूल्य अभिवृद्धि गर्न सक्ने सीप र स्तरीय शिक्षाको विस्तार देशभर एवं समग्र सामाजिक संरचनामा पुग्न अझै बाँकी छ।
४६. यो अवस्थालाई रुपान्तरण गर्न संरचनागत कारणहरू सम्बोधन गर्दै महिलाकेन्द्रित थप अवसरहरू निर्माण गर्नु आवश्यक छ ।
महामहिमहरू,
४७. महिला सशक्तीकरण केवल नैतिक दायित्वको विषयमात्र होइन । दिगो विकास तथा आर्थिक–सामाजिक रुपान्तरणका लागि यो एक अपरिहार्य संवाहक हो ।
४८. समाज एवं कार्यस्थलमा लैङ्गिक मान्यता बारेका रुढिवादलाई बदली संरचनात्मक असमानताको सम्बोधन गर्न जरुरी छ । कतिपय कुरीति र सामाजिक संस्कार कानूनद्वारा सम्बोधन गरेर मात्रै पुग्दैन । त्यसका लागि व्यवहारमा जनचेतना र शिक्षाको विस्तारलाई एकीकृत रुपमा कार्यान्वयन गर्न जरुरी हुन्छ ।
४९. सूचना प्रविधिमा भएको क्रान्तिले कार्यस्थलमा उल्लेख्य संख्यामा महिलाहरूको पहुँचलाई विश्व बजारसम्म पुग्न सम्भव तुल्याएको छ । सशक्तीकरणको साधनको रूपमा इन्टरनेटको सदुपयोग गर्न सम्पर्क सञ्जाल सुदृढ गर्दै यसको पहुँच सर्वसुलभ बनाउन आवश्यक छ ।
५०. नेपालजस्ता भूपरिवेष्ठित तथा अल्पविकसित देशका केहि खास कठिनाई र चासोहरू रहेका छन् । महिलाहरूलाई विश्व उत्पादन मूल्य श्रृखंलामा आबद्ध गर्न अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय समुदायले रचनात्मक भूमिका निर्वाह गर्नु पर्दछ ।
महिला तथा सज्जनवृन्द,
५१. अन्त्यमा, म जोड दिन चाहन्छु कि, नारी शक्ति भनेको सृष्टी, पालन र विकासको शक्ति हो । यो सिर्जनशिलता, संस्कृति र ऐक्यबद्धताको आधारशीला हो ।
५२. महिलाहरूको अवस्था सामाजिक, आर्थिक एवं राजनीतिक रुपमा सुदृढ तुल्याउन घरभित्र, देशभित्र एवं बृहत्तर क्षेत्रमा हाम्रा प्रयासहरू घनीभूत बनाउनु पर्दछ ।
५३. म विश्वका हरेका महिला तथा पुरुषहरूलाई घर–परिवार, समाज, कार्यस्थल, राष्ट्रहरू तथा विश्वमा समानता हासिल गर्नका लागि आफ्ना पहलहरू दोब्बर तुल्याउन आग्रह गर्दछु ।
५४. श्रमिक महिलाको एजेण्डामा शीखर सम्मेलनको आयोजना गर्ने सुझबुझपूर्ण निर्णयको उच्च प्रशंसा गर्दै म लगायत तीनजना महिला राष्ट्राध्यक्षहरूलाई आमन्त्रण गरी सम्बोधन गर्ने अवसर प्रदान गरेकोमा पुनः अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय श्रम संगठनलाई धन्यवाद दिन चाहन्छु । सम्मेलनका उपलब्धीहरूले श्रमिक महिलाको विषयलाई विश्वव्यापी रूपमा प्रवर्द्धन गर्न मद्दत पुग्नेछ भन्ने विश्वास राखेको छु।
धन्यवाद ।

Address by the Rt. Honourable Bidya Devi Bhandari, President of Nepal 
at World of Work Summit
106th Session of the International Labour Conference
Thursday, 15 June 2017
 
Mr. Chairperson
Excellencies the Heads of State of Malta and Mauritius
Director General of the ILO, Mr. Guy Ryder
Distinguished delegates representing the Governments, Employers and the Workers 
Eminent personalities from the world of work
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
At the outset, I thank the Director General of the ILO for the invitation as well as the excellent arrangements made for this important event.
In my capacity as the first woman President of the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal, I feel deeply honoured to represent Nepal and Nepali people in this Summit, convened as a part of the 106th Session of the International Labour Conference.
As I stand before this august gathering to share the historic political achievements made through relentless struggles and sacrifices of Nepali people, I feel the entire nation has been honoured.
We note that international community has been taking keen interest in our transition from conflict to peaceful political transformation alongside the endeavours to transform from conservatism and outmoded social structures. Our journey towards social transformation is ongoing.
I have brought with me warm greetings and best wishes from the Government and hard working people of Nepal, known as the land of Gautama Buddha and Mount Everest.
While addressing this Summit, I appreciate the special contribution made by ILO towards promoting decent, equitable and socially just world of work.
As ILO approaches its 100th anniversary in 2019, I commend it for making ‘Women at Work’ as one of the centenary initiatives.
My sincere appreciation goes to the entire membership of ILO for electing Nepal in the Governing Board during the current session.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
The role trade unions play for the maintenance of harmonious industrial relations and peace ultimately contributes to the economic development and prosperity of society at large. We do acknowledge the role of trade unions in our national advancement too.
The decent work agenda promoted by ILO constitutes a key pillar of fair globalization where everyone becomes a winner. This goal can be achieved if every State accords due regard to the dignity and value of work. In order to make work more dignified, we should create an environment for sharing best practices and promoting innovative ideas.
In the year 2015, the world leaders adopted an ambitious 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
It is a matter of satisfaction that all pillars of the Decent Work Agenda have been duly integrated in the 2030 Agenda.
It has also rightly identified gender equality both as an objective as well as a means for realizing the goals.
Excellencies,
Compared to situation few decades ago, women are more educated and trained now; they have better access to labour market; they represent in increasing number in parliaments; and have more leadership role in governments and enterprises. But the goal towards realizing full gender equality is yet to be achieved.
Societies cannot stand a long time on the shaky foundation of discrimination and inequality. Discrimination against women must come to an end for which we all have to put our meaningful efforts.
Despite decades of efforts, implementation of the international commitments remains weak. Progress of women in the world of work has been slow and inhibited. We continue to languish in low utilization of women’s potentials.
It’s a fact that without political, economic, social and cultural empowerment of women, we cannot imagine the establishment of an equal, just and peaceful society. We must internalize this reality.
As I speak of women in the world of work, I am deeply touched by the cry of migrant women workers in vulnerable situation and their abuse and exploitation. Continued existence of some of the worst forms of labour and modern day slavery in the form of human trafficking and the trafficking of women and girls is an affront to the human civilization. This must not be allowed to continue further.
In the course of my political journey as a student leader, woman activist and a trade unionist, I have closely confronted many constraints. I have myself experienced how arduous and challenging it is for a woman to reach to the position of political leadership in a patriarchal society. However, I have never experienced defeat in my political journey to this point. The message one can learn from this is that with strong commitment and unwavering efforts women can succeed in most difficult political tests.
Excellencies, 
I am happy to share with you that in spite of the constraints imposed by weak economy and prolonged transition and challenges, Nepal has made significant strides towards achieving gender equality – be it in the world of work or in the socio-economic and political spheres. However, these achievements are not the results of coincidence.
We have a long history of struggles to come to the stage we stand today. We have moved from a society where such evil practices as Suttee, child marriage, polyandry, dowry, social exclusion and deprivation prevailed. Many succeeding generations of women, daughters and sisters have shed blood and struggled to secure those rights. Several of them have attained martyrdom in the process.
I feel it important to recall the indomitable courage and sacrifice shown by Yogmaya Neupane who in an adverse social milieu of 1941 joined by her 67 women followers immersed to death in the Arun River in eastern Nepal in protest against misrule and socio-cultural evils. She is a pioneer in the early days of Nepali women’s struggle for their rights. Nepal’s journey of political and social transformation is full of such sagas of sacrifices made by women from all fronts of life. I pay high tribute to all those women leaders.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
After almost seven decades of persistent struggles, on 20th of September 2015, Nepali people wrote the Constitution for themselves through their elected representatives.
The Constitution is founded on the ideals of creating egalitarian society based on the proportional and inclusive principles to ensure equality and social justice and eliminating discrimination and oppression in all its forms and manifestations.
Comparatively speaking, the rights guaranteed by the Constitution are of superior standards.
The Constitution has provisions specific to women such as right against exploitation and violence, equal lineage, and protection by way of positive discrimination in education, health, employment and social security.
There is no restriction on the choice of employment or profession on the basis of gender. Women have equal entitlement to enter and compete for the positions in all public services, including those in civil, military and other security agencies. The number of women peacekeepers from Nepal in various peace operations under the United Nations is increasing. Gender discrimination in wages and remuneration is strictly prohibited. Moreover, employing women in hazardous work is outlawed.
In order to further empower women, a law pertaining to positive discrimination is being implemented in government and public sector jobs. Thirty three percent of the reserved quotas in civil service are guaranteed for women. This has resulted in significant increase in women’s representation in administrative decision making and has opened avenues for gradual rise of women into leadership positions.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Guided by the forward-looking approach, the principle of inclusive representation has been adopted to ensure women’s representation in political positions. For sure, this provision has not remained a mere rhetoric.
I feel proud to state that today the Head of the State and Speaker of Parliament in Nepal are women. Before her mandatory retirement last week, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court was also a woman.
There is already one third representation of women at our Parliament. The Constitution prescribes that the election to President and Vice-President should be held in such a way that ensures representation of different gender or ethnic community. In both houses of the Parliament, either the Speaker or Deputy Speaker has to be a woman.
I would like to cite an example in this regard. Following the people’s movement of 2006, I had the privilege to present a resolution to the restored Parliament proposing mandatory one third representation of women in all entities of the State. I believe that a long journey begins with a small step certainly holds truth.
Proportionally inclusive representation of women has been guaranteed down to the local level. The recently held first phase of elections to the local government bodies has helped to significantly enhance women’s political representation.
The second phase of the elections to be held in two weeks from now will culminate into full realization of mandatory constitutional requirement of at least 40% women’s representation in those elected bodies. Under the new arrangements, women will occupy equal number of leadership positions in local level bodies.
An independent National Women Commission has been established with a power to monitor compliance with women related constitutional and legal provisions as well as Nepal’s international obligations emanating from the instruments to which we are a State party.
As per the provision of the Constitution, the elections to be held in future of the State Assemblies and the Federal Parliament will show a full spectrum of national political firmament that mirrors the mosaic of our social and gender diversity.
The provision of political representation of women that we have followed could serve as a good model to many other countries.
Excellencies,
A State party to 7 out of 8 core ILO Conventions, Nepal’s Constitution has internalized fundamental principles of right to employment, labour and social security as well as the right to form and join trade unions and engage in collective bargaining.
National Employment Policy endorsed by the Government in 2015 has mainstreamed gender and social inclusion policy. The Government has introduced gender budgeting and ensured financial resources to the programmes aimed at promoting gender equality. The President Women Upliftment Programmes being implemented in several districts demonstrates that this agenda has received highest political commitment and priority.
Our progress towards gender equality in labour market is testified by some recent statistics.
Nepal has the highest Female Labour Force Participation Rate in the South Asia region. Our global ranking in this pillar is 17th.
Twenty-two years ago, the participation of women in labour force was close to 66 percent, and this has increased to more than 80 percent as of 2015.
We have put in place requisite policies and legal framework to make presence of ‘women at work’ more decent, safe, gender-friendly and equitable. We have also gradually amended and reformed existing laws and legal structure.
Allow me to put another illustration in the context of women empowerment. We experimented a provision to increase the ownership of land by women. At a time when only 8 percent of the women had land ownership, the cabinet I belonged to adopted a policy of waiving registration fee if land ownership is transferred to a woman. In a matter of a year the land ownership by women increased to 26 percent.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Nepal’s achievement in gender-related MDGs has given us a hope for better future. A good progress was registered in all dimensions – literacy, school enrollment ratio, maternal health, maternal mortality rate, women’s empowerment and political participation. I am happy to state that Nepal ranked 1st in girls’ enrolment in secondary education in the global comparison.
Our effort to address women’s empowerment issues in a more holistic manner has created a dynamic space for women’s participation in economic activities. We are seeing a discernible rise in entrepreneurship under the initiative and leadership of women.
Adoption of gender-friendly policies and practical actions has resulted into enhanced women’s participation in economic structure both as entrepreneurs as well as workers.
Despite several progresses, we have more to do for making the economic structure and labour market equitable for women.
The challenges exist on multiple fronts. Unpaid household work of women is still to be accounted in economy. Skills and quality education that can create value in market have yet to be spread across the country and social structure.
This has to be transformed by addressing structural factors and creating more enabling opportunities specific to the women.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Empowerment of women is not just a moral obligation. It is a key driver essential for sustainable development and socio-economic transformation.
We need to transform gender stereotypes in the society as well as in work place, and address the structural inequality.
Mere laws cannot address all of the social evils and bad practices. A behavioral change through education and awareness must be implemented in an integrated manner.
The revolution in information technology has made it possible for a large number of women to access world labour market. To utilize internet as a tool of empowerment, we must strengthen digital connectivity and ensure its universal access.
Landlocked and least developed countries like Nepal face specific constraints and concerns. The international community must play a constructive role to integrate women in these countries in production value chains.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Before I conclude, I would like to stress that women’s power is the power of creation, nurturing and development. It is the foundation of creativity, culture and solidarity.
To uplift the status of women – socially, economically and politically, we need to intensify our efforts within the households, the national borders and beyond.
I call upon all individuals of the world, women and men alike, to redouble their efforts for achieving equality in household, in society, in workplace, in national life as well as in the world.
In closing, Mr. Chairperson, I reiterate my thankfulness to ILO for the thoughtful decision to hold a Summit on the important agenda of women at work and inviting three women Heads of State, including myself, to address it. I am confident that the outcome of the Summit will help promote the cause of women at the world of work globally.
I thank you all.

Statement by Hon. Nabindra Raj Joshi, Minister for Industry and the Leader of Nepali delegation to the 2017 ECOSOC Forum on Financing for Development Follow-up
New York (22 May 2017)
As delivered


Mr. President,
Honorable Ministers, Excellencies
Distinguished Delegates,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Let me first commend your leadership, Mr. President, in the preparation for and convening of this important second ECOSOC Forum on Financing for Development follow-up leading to the adoption of its outcome document.
As a land-locked, mountainous and least developed country emerging from conflict, and from the devastating earthquakes of 2015, Nepal pins great hope and confidence on this Forum, as it is the right place to address challenges of the countries like mine. In the context that we have already startedthepost-earthquake reconstruction works and have also integrated the SDGs and its targets well into our mainstream national plans and policies, one issue looms large: financing gap for the implementation of SDGs. And it is even more alarming that it is almost already two years since we adopted the Addis Ababa Action Agenda.
The new constitution adopted by the constituent assembly of Nepal incorporating universally accepted democratic and inclusive values and norms, would help create conducive environment for implementation of all internationally agreed development agendas. Now the focus of all the political parties and of the nation is on the economic and social development.
Nepal’s goal to graduate from the LDC status by 2022 needs huge additional investments to achieve the minimum sustained growth. Similarly, the country aims to emerge as an inclusive, equitable, and prosperous middle-income country by 2030. There are challenges before us, which I wish to highlight here briefly:
Nepal, like many other LDCs and LLDCs, continues to face multiple structural challenges and constraints to development and as a result has undergone an unfairly long struggle for development. Without a structural transformation that tackles institutional, financing and capacity constraints, we will continue to remain vulnerable to various economic, social, and environmental shocks.
The private sector has played a key role in the development process as a whole, including in economic growth, employment creation and revenue generation. We have taken every effort to creating an enabling environment for the private sector. To mobilize more private and public resources and to invite more investments from our own people and foreign investors, Nepal recently organized an investment summit in Kathmandu where commitments to the tune of USD 14 billion was expressed. Similarly, we also organized summits on infrastructure and energy.
Mr. President, 
We have realized that to sustain prosperity for a country like ours, domestic resources should account for a large part of the financing for development. We have widened our tax base by formalizing the informal sectors; and have also taken various initiatives such as Special Economic Zones to promote investment and entrepreneurship. Likewise, the Government of Nepal is also committed to modernizing the tax regime and administration and strengthening the capacity to fight money laundering.
The country is getting a substantial remittance inflows from Nepali migrant workers. The Government is committed to creating an environment for productive use of remittancesthrough various institutional mechanisms and financial literacy.
Mr. President,
Climate change has posed threats to our planet. The climate financing should be made adequate, easy and accessible by recognizing this fact of climate vulnerabilities of countries like Nepal.
We cannot achieve the 2030 Agenda by increasing traditional forms of development finance only. Development partners should fully comply with their ODA commitments, facilitate trade and export and also encourage the flow of investments and technologies, in line with the agreed agendas, including the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, Istanbul Programme of Action and Vienna Programme of Action, and also the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
On these many fronts, Nepal supports the statements by the chairs of the Group of 77, LDCs and LLDCs.
Lastly, Mr. President, let me reiterate that the Forum has a broad scope in streamlining our efforts towards full, timely and effective implementation of the 2030 Agenda. This, of course, requires us to join hands for creating a momentum to attain our goals with a view to ensure that no one is left behind. For this to happen, the international community needs to redouble our efforts to translate the commitments into actions. Nepal is committed to do its part.
Thank you!

Mr. Chair Person
Excellencies
Distinguished Guests
Ladies and gentlemen
I feel honored to speak before this august gathering on behalf of the people and Government of Nepal, on the theme “Connectivity of Development Policies and Strategies”. I also express my gratitude to the Government of China for warm hospitality accorded to Nepal delegation upon its arrival to Beijing.
In the interdependent global order development policies, of developing countries like Nepal, are heavily impacted by the others which requires proper understanding and coordination for optimum outputs. Nepal’s geographical location, as a part of belt and road initiative, provides unique opportunity to synergize the benefit of connectivity with Central Asia, Europe, North and East Asia to South Asia. We need to explore the opportunities to enhance connectivity supported by policy coordination for inclusive, sustainable and harmonious development with shared vision ensuring shared prosperity. We have to formulate our strategies and policies to complement and also to benefit from this grand trans-national initiative. We take this initiative as a geo-economic enterprise and are set to reap geographical advantage and share the benefit to everyone in the process.
Our excessive dependence on development assistance has reduced our flexibility to choose alternative policy framework thus have not been able to optimize the development results.  Economic development induced by connectivity towards China, also taking account of ecology consideration, would definitely help us find alternative policy choices.  Once we are connected by railroad of China a new era of possibility will certainly emerge.
The major reason of Nepal’s low economic growth and excessive time taken to implement the development projects is due to poor connectivity between and among the regions. Therefore, the government of Nepal has accorded highest priority for the development of infrastructure pertaining to connectivity.
As we are intended to embark on mutual cooperation mechanism under the belt and road initiative, let us find some synergy in outcomes from the policies and projects related to connectivity that we introduce. On behalf of the government of Nepal, I would like to assure all associated with B & R initiative that Nepal is ready to work together with you for realizing the goal of creating harmonious and prosperous society for more equitable and just global order. I wish the Forum a success. Thank you.

Statement by Rt. Hon. Prime Minister On “Nepal China Relations: Prospects on Growth and Prosperity” At Beijing Foreign Studies University
26 March 2017
 
President of the University Mr. Peng Long
Professors
Scholars and Academicians
Dear Students
Ladies and Gentlemen
 
I feel honoured to address this gathering of learned scholars, youthful students and friends of Nepal. I would like to extend my gratitude to President Mr. Peng Long for extending kind invitation to join you all at this university.
I feel overwhelmed to attend today’s programme at this university, the university which has an illustrious history and legacy; whose roots are deeply imbedded with the very dawn of new China.
Since its establishment in 1941, this University has been a pioneer in language studies, international affairs and country specific studies. It is a matter of distinguished pleasure to be here at this institution that has been rightly called as a Cradle of Diplomats.
Today, we inaugurated the Centre for Nepali Studies at this University. I believe that, in the University’s mission to “introduce China to the world and introduce the world to China”, opening of the Center is another remarkable milestone.
Ladies and Gentlemen
Our nations have a long history of harmonious relations. The relationship dates back to antiquity, rooted in our histories that have co-existed together.
We are connected by geography, civilization linkage; by trade and people-to-people exchanges.
The influence of Buddha’s teachings is evident in the cultural values of our countries. There is this thread of similarity that runs through history; that runs across the Himalayas.
In early 5th century, Nepali monk and scholar Buddhabhadra visited China. In first half of the 7thcentury Princess Bhrikuti of Nepal was married to Tibetan King. In the second half of 13th century Arniko visited China and contributed in art and archaeology.
Similarly, early visits of Chinese monks and scholars like Monk Fa Hsian and Monk Xuan Zang to Nepal are etched strongly in our history.
Building on the rich tradition, our visionary leaders laid down foundations for everlasting friendship and good neighbourliness.
Along the course of time, our countries have witnessed change. The economic miracle of China is remarkable.
Similarly, Nepal has gone through monumental changes. We have cross many political milestones.
Regardless of the political changes, our relations have remained unshaken. This is the constant of our relations. This is also the uniqueness of our relationship.
No matter who leads the government in Nepal, our friendship with government and people of China is robust and resolute. This is the enduring feature of our relations.
Irrespective of the changes in global milieu, Nepal-China relations is the one of continued peaceful coexistence.
Our relations have been firmly fortified on the foundations of Panchasheel. Principle of sovereign equality, non-interference and respect for each other’s sensitivities have guided our strong friendship.
Nepal adheres to one-China policy. We are committed to not allowing hostile activities against China on our soil.
We have cooperated with each other on many areas and at various levels -bilateral, regional and global.
China has been our reliable and trusted partner for development. Our partnership goes beyond the economic and social spheres. The spontaneous assistance rendered by Chinese government and people in the immediate aftermath of earthquake in 2015, won the hearts of Nepali people.
The generous pledge made by China for Nepal’s post-disaster reconstruction testifies to our cordial friendship.
I would like to thank the Government and People of China for their generous assistance and support.
Dear Friends
Vision of Chinese leadership and diligence of Chinese people have made China a global economic powerhouse. This has elevated the stature of China in world affairs.
The success story of China has been a source of inspiration for developing world. The growth performance of China has been a key driver of global growth.
While China makes incredible progress in every sphere, we, as a country with least developed economy, suffer from several bottlenecks. In our pursuit to dismantle those hurdles, we have begun with consolidation of political progress and now, our focus is on economic development. Our country, endowed as it is with both human and natural resources, has tremendous potentials for development.
In Nepal, we have put our commitment and resolve together to unleash our potentials.
China’s support and goodwill in helping the development pursuits of Nepal has been outstanding.
The generous assistance extended by China in the field of infrastructure development has been instrumental in our pursuits for prosperity.
Not only geography, markets have connected us.
Not only history, destiny has connected us.
Not only our past, the prospect of prosperous future has connected us.
Dear Friends 
In realizing the prospects for shared prosperity, we have already set the beginning. Our partnership can change the economic landscape of Nepal.
China’s One Belt One Road Initiative offers tremendous opportunities for collaboration and partnership. I would like to thank President Xi Jinping for this initiative.
Looking back, some of you may be aware, Nepal used to be an important thoroughfare in the ancient silk route. It was a vibrant trade entrépot that connected parts of Central Asia with South Asia.
It is not a surprise –in that period of history, Asia was a pioneer in global trade and economy. It was a hub of innovation, a land of prosperity.
We can build on that legacy, and create a modern success story. Success story of connectivity; of development; of mobility; and of shared prosperity.
Nepal has already signed an MOU on Belt and Road Initiative in 2014, we are in the final stage of concluding the extended MOU.
Nepal and China have multiple avenues for partnership. We remain committed to fully implementing the agreements and understandings reached in the past.
Our engagement in the Asian Infrastructure Bank is a case in point. Similarly Nepal has become a Dialogue Partner of Shanghai Cooperation Organization since last year.
And, most importantly, our bilateral engagement and business linkage is the major platform to harness the prospects for growth and prosperity.
Recently, on 2nd and 3rd of this month, we concluded the Nepal Investment Summit. It saw investors and business persons from different parts of the world. And of total investment pledges more than 60 percent came from Chinese investors.
In terms of FDI flows, China tops the chart.
The flow of Chinese tourists to Nepal is another important façade of our relations.
The flow of Chinese tourists has a contributing role in our economic growth. And more importantly, this provides an important bridge for our cultures, for our peoples.
Government of Nepal has waived visa fee for Chinese tourists as a token of friendship. We need to join hands to promote the tourism potentials of Nepal among the Chinese visitors. Tourist arrival from China has important bearing on Nepal’s tourism industry.
I would like to welcome the great Chinese people, to make a visit to Nepal –the birth place of Shakyamuni Buddha, the land of Everest. Our natural beauty and cultural mosaic will enthrall you and make you long for more.
Ladies and Gentlemen
Last year we signed Agreement on Transit Transport. This is an agreement of paramount importance for making landlocked Nepal a land-linked nation. Early conclusion of Protocol is in our priority.
Connectivity remains our key priority. Connectivity of infrastructures as well as ideas, connectivity of markets as well as minds. This can be a true propeller in our pursuit for prosperity.
Connectivity of roads, railways, airways and web links can unleash the potential for shared prosperity.
We need to resume the Tatopani/Zhangmu border point at the earliest. In our annals of partnership, this port has a historical significance. Similarly opening of more border points between our countries can strengthen our cross-border connectivity.
Similarly, we have to focus on expanding aviation sector. More flights and direct air links between Kathmandu and major cities of China can be rewarding to both the countries.
The richness of water resources in Nepal is tremendous. This resource can be utilized for creating green and sustainable energy, for creating a very base for growth.
Investment in mega hydropower projects can be beneficial to Nepal as well as Chinese investors.
Energy security is a key for economic development. We can cooperate to diversify and develop our energy mix by investing in solar power, bio energy and other alternative sources.
There exist tremendous opportunity for cooperation on urban infrastructures, cross border transmission lines, telecommunication and ICT.
China has established itself a key hub of innovation in railways, agriculture, electronics, computing and smart technology. Its development experience is unparalleled treasure to learn from.
To drive our growth, transfer of technology can be a key sector.
Transfer of technology –which is affordable.
–which is reliable. –which is transformative.
Ladies and Gentlemen, 
Nepal has a vibrant and energetic youth population –full of energy, aspiration and potential. However, we have not been able to retain their energy at home.
Partnership between Nepal and China in terms of investment can be instrumental to create jobs for them and utilize their energy.
The location of Nepal provides a unique opportunity for connecting China with South Asia. Harnessing of this potential can bear fruits for China and Nepal as well as the region.
It can be a vital framework to pursue collaborative development projects, which can be mutually beneficial for all the countries in the region.
Dear Students
As I said earlier, you are in one of the pioneer universities in China. It is a great opportunity as well as a matter of pride for you.
I also see some faces from Nepal here. And some Chinese students who are studying Nepali language.
I am overwhelmed to share that China is increasingly becoming one of the most preferred foreign destinations for Nepali students. The very rigor of Chinese universities can contribute to develop our human resources, and ultimately help create a robust workforce that will pedal the forces of development.
Similarly, the number of Chinese students studying in various institutes and universities of Nepal is growing.
I am also keen to promote enhanced collaboration between Beijing Foreign Studies University and universities in Nepal for joint academic ventures and academic exchanges.
Academic exchanges and interaction among the scholars from our countries can spark new ideas, can connect the minds. With connected minds, we can aspire for miracles.
 It makes me believe that our future is in the safe hands of our youths –whose creativity, innovativeness and diligence will be the driving force for our growth and prosperity.
As it is said, this century belongs to Asia. And undoubtedly, China has an important role to play in making this a century a century of growth.
Responsibility lies on us, on our collective wisdom to make an Asian century, a century of growth as well as development.
A century of prosperity as well as accommodativeness.
A century where winner won’t take all but all will be winners.
Ladies and Gentlemen
As I said earlier, Nepal has passed through political changes of historic proportions.
Now our priority is on economic prosperity. We are aspiring to reach middle-income status by 2030.
We count on China’s continued support in our economic transformation. And it is my belief that a prosperous Nepal is also in the interest of our friend China.
Saying this, allow me to thank Mr. Peng Long for this platform for exchanging our views on Nepal China Relations and sharing our ideas for harnessing the prospects of growth and prosperity.
I thank You all!

Your Excellencies Heads of State and Government 
Secretary General of Boao Forum for Asia 
Distinguished Delegates
Ladies and Gentlemen
 
It is a great honour to address this distinguished gathering of political and business leaders as well as academics and professionals from various continents.
The Annual Conference of Boao Forum provides an important platform for sharing of perspectives and nobel ideas for prosperity of Asia, prosperity of humanity.
I would like to thank the Government of the People’s Republic of China and the Boao Forum for Asia for the invitation and excellent arrangements made for our gathering in this beautiful island of Hainan Province.
Distinguished Delegates
A single word that has been in extensive use in our world is –globalization. Though this single word may not have single meaning, the pursuit is one. Pursuit of development, progress and prosperity. Pursuit of greater connectivity, mobility and integration.
In past few decades, globalization and international trade has brought fundamental transformations in the living standards of the people–of developed as well as developing world. Decline of extreme poverty from the level of 47 percent in 1990 to below 14 percent today is just one example.
A backbone of global economy, globalization is a key force of development.
It is that force, which has lifted millions out of poverty.
However, it has not been an unalloyed feat.
The role of globalization and freedom of trade in making our world wealthier has been undeniable. But many have felt that they have been left behind in the process. Many have felt that marginalization has also been a corollary to globalization. In sharing of the fruits of globalization, there has been a visible asymmetry.
This very asymmetry has led to apprehensions in various parts of the world –developed as well as developing. It has created an atmosphere of uncertainty and cynicism.
And, to provide the anchor of stability in these uncertain times, Asia has an important role. To steer the raft of free trade, Asia has an undeniable onus.
We have to make sure that globalization triumphs cynicisms as well as complacence. Globalization –which is more inclusive and reinvigorated. Globalization –which does not create a dichotomy of winners and losers rather a win-win situation for all.
Ladies and Gentlemen
For a long stretch of history, Asia used to be a global economic powerhouse; a land of innovators and inventors; and a continent of civilizations and commerce.
Now in the 21st century, the center of gravity of global economy is shifting towards Asia. It is emerging as the engine of global growth. A hub of trade and a hub of innovation.
In the process of globalization, Asia has made its contribution as well as gained the fruits.
But, we must not forget –there are still many countries in Asia for whom globalization has not bestowed with benefits.
There are still some barriers that hinder the free flow of goods and services from the countries, which are at lower rung of development.
Success and sustainability of globalization must rest on inclusiveness. We must ensure the equality of opportunities as well as ability to reap benefits of globalization. We should strive for a level playing field –that is even and fair.
Inclusiveness lies at the core of Asian culture. For centuries, different nations, religions and civilizations have co-existed with each other and flourished equally.
The same inclusiveness is possible and must prevail while we continue to embark upon the path of globalization and free trade.
21st century is rightly said to be the Asian Century. A century of shared benefit and shared destiny.
To materialize the Asian model of globalization, we must build a cooperation model, which will enable free flow of ideas, unimpeded links of trade and an enduring instance of win-win situation
Undoubtly, trade is the engine of growth. But for countries like Nepal, which is least developed and landlocked, enhanced market access through duty free quota free provisions, streamlined and simplified rules and procedures, trade capacity building as well as trade facilitating measures including smooth transit arrangements would be essential for them to benefit from globalization. We expect globalization to contribute to economic transformation which is critical to sustain political transformation.
Ladies and Gentlemen 
Nepal has entered the phase of economic transformation crossing many political milestones. Our priority now is to accelerate economic growth and development.
I would like to invite the Asian business community to invest in various profitable sectors including hydropower, infrastructure development and tourism in Nepal. We have a rich resource base. Many of the sectors are virgin in terms of investment and are equally profitable.
Our growing domestic market and our location among the largest economies of Asia bear an immense prospect to establish Nepal as a trade hub; a vital link in global value chain.
We can realize this potential of my country as well our continent by making globalization work for all. By ensuring an inclusive globalization for all and free and fair trade. By building on the opportunities offered by globalization and free trade for the common prosperity of Asia and the world.
To create a more wealthier world, we must strive for:
Inclusion not isolation
Partnership not protectionism
Bridges not barriers
Freedom while trading not fears
I believe that we have enough foresight, big-heartedness and courage to tread upon this path- a path of Asian prosperity, a path of shared prosperity.
Thank You!

Excellencies
Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is indeed a great honour to be invited to speak before the distinguished participants of Raisina Dialogue. I congratulate Ministry of External Affairs of India and Observer Research Foundation for successfully steering India’s flagship conference on issues of global importance.
I am confident that the deliberations during this dialogue would be helpful in generating new insights on how we can act as regional and global community to overcome the persistent as well as emerging challenges we face and navigate towards greater peace, security, development and prosperity. We appreciate India’s commitment to contribute to this end through the annual holding of this Dialogue.
Ladies and Gentlemen
Although we have achieved a remarkable success in global economic growth, technological advancement and unprecedented level of globalization, we are witnessing unexpected political developments, tragic humanitarian crises in several zones of conflict, and brutal terror attacks around the world.
New fault-lines are emerging. Uncertainties are visible. Cradle of liberal world order and opennessis yielding to the appeals of closed nationalism. Places that led the idea of free flow of goods and services are now talking about barriers and restrictions. We live today amidst perplexing contradictions.
None of us deny that the enormous challenges humanity confronts today do not have unilateral solution. Solutions are multilateral. Yet these institutions suffer more than ever today from our own skepticism and lack of accommodative spirit.
Reform of these institutions so as to make them inclusive and reflective of changing realities has remained elusive.
In 2015, we demonstrated our collective ability to address global challenges by adopting SDGs and Paris Agreement. Nevertheless,agreements on several critical agendas of multilateral process have been hard to reach. Implementation of agreed agendas is another big challenge.
We have seen significant evolution of regional institutions — in scope as well as substance. New regional and sub-regional groupings are gaining footing in global politics. Yet, in many regions process of regional integration is marching backward.
In terms of knowledge, technology, trade and investment, the world is more integrated than ever. Thanks to the technological innovation, physical distance has evaporated.  But, backlashes against globalization are building up. Political developmentsare apparently moving in a reverse gear. Rhetoric of barriers rather than bridges is getting popular.
Years ago, the world celebrated the end of Cold War and was prompted to nurture hope that big power rivalry would reduce the costly militarization. Two and half decades later, the world’s military expenditure is historic high and many times higher than what we collectively spend in people’s health and education.
We saw the ideological rivalry was fading and rule of law and democracy were gaining ground. Twenty-five years later, democratic institutions and polity have made tremendous strides, but still face challenges of enormous scale.
New forces of division in the form of sectarian violence, religious extremism and terrorism are gaining ground posing great threat to individual liberty, democratic institutions and rule of law.
Never in history had our world been so affluent. Yet the gap between rich and poor is big and alarmingly visible. Contradictions like these lead to a host of colossal challenges which we face today and which we must find ways to address.
Ladies and Gentlemen:
Though absolute number of poor has declined drastically, poverty, hunger and underdevelopment are the world’s major challenges today as they were before. One fourth of the members of international community are still the least developed countries struggling to provide a minimum decent living to their people.
Despite decades of efforts, their quest for developmental transformation has received setbacks. They are constrained by lack of resources. International support measures have not been either effective or adequate.
In the highly interconnected world, these countries tend to bear the most painful brunt of global crises and market fluctuations of every kind.
Most of these countries struggled to achieve Millennium Development Goals and are now facing an uphill task to pursue Sustainable Development Goals. They face the threat of shrinking development assistance and such assistance is increasingly diverted away from much-needed critical infrastructure and productive sector. Trade preference aimed to enhance these countries’ export share increasingly faces preference erosion.
Threat of climate change has become more pronounced than ever. When it comes to vagaries and vicissitudes of Mother Nature, the poor are the first to suffer as they lack capacity to adapt.
A low industrialized country like Nepal emits insignificantly low amount of green house gases and has no contribution to global warming. But impact of global warming is already visible in terms of erratic climate conditions and melting of glaciers and ices in Himalayan region, which would not only trigger problems in Nepal but also pose threat of water crisis in south Asian region.
Those who have resource and technology are preoccupied with maintaining momentum of growth and affluence while countries on the other side of developmental spectrum are distressed by how their people survive amidst drying farmlands and diminishing water sources.
We are, therefore, concerned about how effectively the Paris Agreement will be implemented particularly by big actors and whether this will be sufficient to curb global warming within the scientifically prescribed limit.
Terrorism continues to remain the alarming threat to peace and stability at the global as well as at our own region. Resolute international and regional actions including binding legal instrument are essential to fight this menace. In our pursuit to defeat terrorism, we should not limit ourselves in words; our actions should be resolute.
Migration has become an inevitable phenomenon of the contemporary world. Movement of people has brought both benefits and challenges. Their contribution to both the development and growth of host economies as well as countries of origin are immense. Welfare and protection of the rights and well being of migrant workers must be our common priority.
As we strive for rapid socio-economic development, efforts to attain the universal and transformative 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (SDGs) remain paramount. In this regard, sound development policies and frameworks backed by proper institutional mechanism, adequate resources and innovative methods of implementation are essential along with robust international partnership and fulfillment of agreed commitments.
Energy security is an important component of sustainable development and economic security. Energy cooperation should be directed towards ensuring energy security for all.
In this context, development of hydropower in Nepalis the area that promises great opportunities for partnership. We have not been able to fully exploit its huge water resources potential despite the pressing need of clean energy in our region. Investment and technology, enhanced inter connectivity and access to power markets are essential to harness the full potential. I am happy to state that Nepal and India are working towards open market access in power trade at bilateral and sub regional level.
Ladies and Gentlemen
Nepal is strongly convinced that greater regional integration is beneficial to all and guided by this conviction, my country has actively contributed to the regional processes of SAARC and BIMSTEC. However, evolution of SAARC process has been painfully slow to achieve regional integration and we must address its root causes to materialize the noble vision of regional prosperity and integration.
We are also working actively in sub-regional framework of BBIN to achieve greater cross border connectivity and cooperation in vital sectors of trade, transit and energy.
Closer to our neighbourhood, Nepal and India have been consolidating a deeper partnership for growth and prosperity. Our challenges are common and successful practices on one side of the border areindeed worth emulating on the other side as well.
We are inspired by the phenomenal progress India is making in all fronts ranging from economic growth, science and technology and rule of law to consolidation of democracy. How we can rise as a close neighbour with India’s rise is our key interest.We are impressed by some of the bold initiatives India has taken under Prime Minister Modiji’s leadership to ensure digital and financial access to the poor and fight against corruption. Nepal is also working towards these goals.
Prime Minister Modiji sparked great optimism when he articulated the vision of ‘sabkasaath, sabkaabikas‘ and neighbourhood first policy. We like to see greater translation of this vision into concrete deliverables — be it in the form of more trade,investment and connectivity in the form of railways, highways and transmission infrastructure;and mega projects as joint undertaking.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
On socio-political context at home, I am pleased to share with this august gathering that Nepal has achieved transformation of historic proportion in the past ten years. Transition has been lengthy, costly and at times full of uncertainties. But our leadership has been able to manage the complicated process with due diligence.
Decade long armed conflict gave way to peaceful political process. And just last year the historic promulgation of the Constitution marked the realization of long-held dream of Nepali people for inclusive and democratic polity. We are thankful to India’s continued support in our quest for peace and democracy.
The Constitution now provides a rights-based and forward-looking foundation of the country’s governance and a framework to accommodate the socially, culturally and geographically diverse Nepali society. Our efforts are ongoing to accommodate everyone within the constitutional framework by addressing their legitimate concerns and we are confident that we will succeed. As a major step in the implementation of the Constitution, we will hold elections at local, provincial and national levels within a year.
We want to utilize our full potential. The goodwill, solidarity and support from our neighbours and international community will be important as we move towards effective implementation of the Constitution and undertaking of the vital tasks of socio-economic transformation of Nepal.
Despite having suffered from decade long conflict and then long political transition, Nepal has made significant progress in social development. We want to build on that.
Needless to say that peaceful, prosperous and developed Nepal can be an instrumental force for peace and security and a catalyst for a more constructive partnership in the region and beyond.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I believe that today’s problems can be resolved by harmonizing national, institutional, communal and individual interests with regional and global developments.
For this, we need to build new Highways of Hope and Healings connecting all states and peoples.
We need to emerge out of our cynicism as well as complacence.
We need to build bridges rather than barriers.
We need to act in synergy rather than silos.
We need to embrace connectivity rather than cynical cocoons.
We need to embrace rule of law and shun violence as means to bring changes
As we face unprecedented challenge to tackle the problems of global scale, we do have enormous opportunities too.
Such opportunities exist in the form of growing technological prowess, increasing physical connectivity, larger educated mass worldwide, greater degree of cultural interface and many more.
The dexterity and innovativeness of youth is the key for our future. It is the key to build resilience, address challenges and to provide practical remedies to the maladies of world. We must engage the large population of youth in mainstream of ‘big politics’. To nurture their creativity, we must educate their curiosity. To channelize their energy, we must fill them with positive purpose.
We should build on these assets to transform the world into a better place to live in for ourselves as well as the generations to come; for people living in affluence as well as those in abjection; for countries in the upper rung of development spectrum as well as those in the tail end.
To change, society must create the environment for the intelligent and diligent to prosper and excel but protect the weak and vulnerable. Only then islands of prosperity expand to include oceans of denial and deprivation; only winners take all mindset may make everyone loser. A great Indian soul Swami Vivekananda said long ago “we are what our thoughts make us”.
Indeed this is the moment for making hard choices if we comprehend the complexities of the present and prepare for the new age together. Nothing less than a robust and transformative political, economic, social and national security and foreign policy architecture will give outlet from the problems we face. Leadership of wisdom and courage, ethics and morality can create a new collective consciousness bringing everyone together in the culture of peace and tolerance, coexistence and cooperation as best represented by Buddha and Gandhi. Inspired by them, can our dialogue reflect on a new politics of liberty, law and security, economics of free enterprise with equity, society of social justice, caring and sharing, culture of reward for good work and punishment for bad and policy of friendship with all and hostility with none as the foundation of this new global architecture for the 21st Century?
As responsible governments, and leaders of society and businesses, we should ensure fulfillment of people’s desires and their prosperity and freedom. We have the capacity, means and resources to address the challenges and ensure prosperity. What we need is the will power to achieve this and as we do so, we must be reminded to carry along the countries and societies that are languishing at the bottom of the development ladder.

I wish for the success of the 2nd edition of Raisina Dialogue.
Thank you.

Statement delivered by the Rt. hon. Prime Minister of Nepal at the opening ceremony of 10th World Future Energy Summit in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates
Posted onJanuary 16, 2017January 16, 2017 

Statement delivered by The Rt. Hon’ble Mr. Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’, Prime Minister of Nepal at the 
Opening Ceremony of the Tenth Session of  the
World Future Energy Summit
Abu Dhabi, January 16, 2017
Your Highness Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed Al Nahyan
Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of  UAE Armed Forces,
Your Highnesses
Your Excellencies
Distinguished Delegates
Delegates of Business Communities
Ladies and Gentlemen, 

It is a great honour to address the distinguished gathering of leaders from political, business, industry, academic spheres and journalist at this opening ceremony of World Future Energy Summit hosted on the occasion of its 10th anniversary celebration.
I would like to thank His Highness the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi for the kind invitation extended to me to attend this summit. I am impressed by the excellent arrangements made for the conference.
I take this opportunity to thank the Government and people of United Arab Emirates for the warm welcome and generous hospitality extended to my delegation ever since our arrival in this beautiful capital city of Abu Dhabi.
As one of the largest gathering for sustainable energy and clean technologies, the World Future Energy Forum provides an excellent opportunity to engage in dialogue for achieving a common goal:
– a goal of greener and cleaner future;
– a goal of developed and more prosperous future, and
-a goal of sustainable future.
As the UAE is playing a prominent and inspiring role in revolutionizing the energy sector, this event is a fitting tribute to UAE’s contributions to the development of energy sector and clean energy solutions. We sincerely appreciate UAE’s notable initiative in this field.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Needless to say, energy is the lifeline for development; lifeline of progress; and lifeline of prosperity.
In 2015, the world leaders agreed upon a solemn pledge for sustainable future by adopting SDGs.
And, the 7th goal says – ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all.
Unfortunately, one in five people still lacks access to modern electricity.
In the same year, we reached an ambitious and comprehensive Paris Agreement to tackle the menace of climate change and global warming. We collectively agreed to curb the emissions and pledged for a greener future.
Unfortunately, around 60 percent of the total greenhouse emissions is due to our carbon-intensive consumption of energy.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
We have made our pledges. We have reached several agreements.
And, the time implores us to act on those pledges; to implement the agreements; and to deliver on our promises, for gap between commitment and delivery erodes our credibility.
Access to affordable and renewable energy must be treated as a universal right that no one should be denied.
Our cooperation on energy sector must create a win-win situation for all countries and all peoples to grow and prosper.
The world reliant on fossil fuel and traditional energy cannot alone provide the answer in ensuring affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all.
And, obviously the answer is clean energy.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Clean energy is the ultimate enabler to realize the development goals, without jeopardizing the environment.
We must invest our resources in clean energy sources and renewable energy. Much of the potential of harnessing sustainable energy is lying dormant while 3 billion people rely on wood, coal, charcoal or animal waste for cooking and heating.
The future of energy lies in clean energy sources such as hydropower, solar, wind and thermal. Identification and development of renewable sources of energy and its judicious distribution together with related technologies must constitute the center pillar of our cooperative efforts to ensure energy security to every one.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
When it comes to hydropower, Nepal was an early mover. We installed a 500-Kilowatt hydropower project back in 1911.
This was just 29 years after the first hydropower project was installed in Wisconsin, the US, and one year before China built its first hydropower project.
Unfortunately, after more than a century of first hydropower project in Nepal, above 30 percent of the population is yet to have access to electricity and is forced to depend on traditional fuels for energy requirements.
Acute energy crisis had been a bleak reality, until my government managed to reduce the power cuts by building efficiency in supply side.
Nepal’s theoretical hydroelectric potential has been estimated to be as high as 83,000 Megawatts (MW) of which 42,000 Megawatts is considered to be technically and economically feasible.
Similarly, Nepal has a huge potential for solar energy. It is located at favourable latitude that receives ample amounts of solar radiation. It has more than 300 days of sunshine in a year.
By utilizing just 0.01% of the total land area of Nepal, we can harness around 2,920 Gigawatt Hours (GWh) of energy per year from solar power.
That is almost equal to the energy from 251, 243 (two hundred 51 thousands) tons of oil.
Located between the two of the largest growing economies, Nepal could become a major energy exporter to our neighbourhood and South Asia.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Emerging out of a protracted political transition, our key agenda and the need of the hour is to advance economic development.
Nepal is targeting graduation from LDC status to developing country status by 2022 and aims to become a middle-income country by 2030. To meet these targets, Nepal will need at least 6,000 Megawatts of additional energy.
For realizing our development targets by achieving an economic growth rate of decent 7.2%, total capacity of 25,000 Megawatts will have to be installed by 2040.
As we intend to intensify development efforts, investment in energy sector is full of potential.
Lots of industries and infrastructure projects are in pipeline. There are vast opportunities for development of transportation and service sectors. This opens up huge avenues for investment in energy.
Investment opportunities lie in the upgradation and expansion of distribution system and transmission system.
In 2016, Government of Nepal endorsed the ‘Action Plan on National energy Crisis Alleviation and Electricity Development Decade’, which targets to generate 10,000 Megawatts by 2025 through a roadmap for policy reforms and initiatives to spur private sector investment.
We have adopted liberal policy in foreign investment.
Government of Nepal adopted Renewable Energy Subsidy Policy last year for increasing investment in micro-hydro and solar energy.
We have provided several incentives to promote investment in energy sector, such as tax rebates, concessional duty, excise duty and refunds, up-to 100% repatriation of profit.
Our labour policy is market friendly. Moreover, we have abundance of cheap labours. We are committed to taking for the measures to create conducive industrial environment.
In addition to these policies, we are open to sign separate Programme Development Agreements with investors, for boosting their confidence.
One window system and small bureaucracy are other advantages. Nepal ranks 2nd among the South Asian countries in Ease of Doing Business index.
Nepal welcomes the investment venture from firms across the world in its energy sector.
The Power Trade Agreement (PTA) has been signed with India. This has opened up a large market for exporting electricity to India.
Similarly, South Asian countries signed the SAARC Framework agreement on Energy Cooperation during the 18th SAARC summit. This is an important step towards the eventual formation of regional energy market.
I would like to extend invitation to you, Dear Business Delegates, for attending Nepal Investment Summit on 2nd and 3rd March this year. The upcoming summit will adopt policies to attract investments in priority areas like clean energy.
Rest assured –investment in Nepal’s energy sector is profitable.
Rest assured –investment in Nepal’s hydropower is safe and secure.
If we are able to tap such resources across the world, Ladies and Gentlemen, the future will be bright and clean.
In conclusion, I stress that greener, more prosperous and more sustainable future is possible and achievable. What we need is strong political commitment, vision, partnership and collaboration coupled with intensive investment.
I wish this summit all success!
I thank you all!
Shukran!

And all the participants,
I would like to extend a warm welcome to the Rt. Hon. President, Rt. Hon. Vice-President and all the distinguished guests to this reception organized by Rt. Hon Prime Minister on the occasion of 68th International Human Rights Day and would like to express my gratitude to you for sparing your invaluable time for this programme.
The concept of inalienable, indivisible and universal human rights related to a person’s life, freedom, equality, dignity and justice are being accepted by the world as milestone for human race and civilization and tireless efforts are being made to express and implement it in practice.
In particular, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948 adopted by the United Nations after the devastating destruction of property and lives experienced during the Second World War, has established international standards and principles for protection, promotion, respect and fulfillment of human rights.
The outreach and dimension of human rights have been widening because of creative explanation and activism of mechanisms and systems created for implementation under various international conventions and agreements related to human rights which were made after the Declaration.  In recent times, the concept of human rights has been established as dynamic values.
Today, the subject of human rights is not only limited to a person’s civil and political rights but economic, social and cultural rights, right to development, right to live in healthy environment, right for peace and the inclusive rights of the marginalized people to receive assurance of special protection and opportunity from the state are novel stages of human rights. All the nations have shown collective commitment and activism and to end all kinds of discrimination, inequality and injustice while developing the infrastructures to provide practical assurances of these rights.
As an active member of the United Nations, Nepal has been expressing both at the national and international level its unflinching commitment towards human rights. Nepal is a party to majority of conventions related to human rights and it has been making various constitutional, legal, policy wise, institutional and programmatic provisions to implement the responsibilities that arise from these instruments.  The Government of Nepal has been keeping substantial provisions for human rights issues in it Policies and Programs and Budget also including for providing special protection to marginalized and endangered groups to eradicate poverty and maintaining economic prosperity in the country. Specially, positive changes are seen in the social and economic development indicators. Nepal has also made significant progress in the indicators for child and maternal mortality rate, safe maternal services, average age, increase in the access to education and health, continuous growth in the access to clean drinking water and social empowerment. However, we are very much aware regarding the negative impacts posed by the challenges of assuring sustainable and high economic growth poverty alleviation to ensure human rights. We are confronted by the challenge to develop various infrastructures to enable the citizens to enjoy the 31 fundamental rights guaranteed in the Constitution of Nepal promulgated through the Constitution Assembly.
The Government has given high priority for the development of infrastructures to guarantee the practical assurances of the rights guaranteed in the Constitution and it is striving with planning to disburse the resources and the means accordingly and to make the government’s mechanism more effective and accountable. In the course of implementation of the Constitution and federalism, progress in human rights and overall would be achieved through everyone’s help, understanding, patience and acumen in the transitional management for restructuring, service delivery and economic prosperity. We are confident that we will be able to execute our obligation towards human rights as the implementation of the Constitution has provided plenty of opportunities for us to fulfill and respect human rights.
In its endeavor to implement its international obligation, the Government has been timely submitting its periodic reports as provisioned in various international conventions to which Nepal is a party and it has also been making action plans in accordance with the decisions of the Human Rights Council and the recommendations of various implementation agencies for treaties. Also, the government, as per its resources, means and capacity is trying to implement the recommendations received from the Human Rights Council and the decisions of the Supreme Court. This has helped markedly to develop the culture of human rights.
At last, the occasion of International Human Rights Day has inspired us all to respect, protect and complement human rights in a more committed and dynamic way. I request all the national and international organizations, partners in development, human rights workers and concerned all to assist the government in its endeavor and plan to tackle the challenges in the area of human rights and guarantee human rights for all.
Now, may I request to all the Excellences , dignitaries and representatives of diplomatic community to proceed to the dais for courtesy meeting with Rt. Hon. President of Nepal and other dignitaries.

Thank You!

खासगरी दोस्रो विश्वयुद्धमा भएको व्यापक धन, जनको क्षति पश्चात संयुक्त राष्ट्रसंघको अगुवाइमा जारी भएको मानव अधिकार सम्बन्धी विश्वव्यापी घोषणा पत्र, १९४८ ले मानव अधिकारको सम्मान, संरक्षण, प्रवर्द्धन र परिपूर्तिको लागि अन्तराष्ट्रियस्तरमा आधारभूत मानक र सिद्धान्त तय गरेको छ । उक्त घोषणापत्र जारी भए पछि बनेका मानव अधिकार सम्बन्धी विभिन्न अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय महासन्धि एवं अनुवन्धहरुको व्यवस्था तथा तिनको कार्यान्वयन सम्बन्धी संयन्त्रको सक्रियता र रचनात्मक व्याख्याले मानव अधिकारको दायरा र आयाम फराकिलो हुँदै गएको छ । पछिल्लो समयमा मानवअधिकारको अवधारणा एक गतिशिल मान्यताको रुपमा स्थापित भएको छ ।
आज मानव अधिकारको बिषय- ब्यक्तिको नागरिक तथा राजनीतिक अधिकारमा मात्र सीमित नरही आर्थिक, सामाजिकतथा सास्कृतिक अधिकार, विकासको अधिकार, स्वस्थ्य वातावरणमा बाँच्न पाउने अधिकार, शान्तिको अधिकार एवंसीमान्तकृत वर्गले राज्यबाट विशेष संरक्षण र अवसर प्राप्त गर्ने समावेशी अधिकार जस्ता नविन अधिकारकोप्रत्यभूतिको चरण सम्म आइपुगेको छ । यी अधिकारहरुको व्यवहारिक प्रत्याभूतिको लागि आवश्यक पर्ने पूर्वाधारहरको विकास गर्दै समाजमा रहेका सवै प्रकारका विभेद, असमानता र अन्यायको स्थिति अन्त्य,सुशासन अभिवृद्धि र न्यायएवं समानता सुनिश्चित गर्न सम्पूर्ण राष्ट्रहरुले राष्ट्रिय एवं अन्तराष्ट्रिय स्तरमा साझा प्रतिबद्धता र क्रियशिलता समेत देखाएका छन् ।

मानव अधिकार प्रतिको अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय दायित्वको कार्यान्वन गर्नेसिलसिलामा नेपाल पक्ष भएका अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय महासन्धिहरुको व्यवस्था अनुसार पेश गर्नु पर्ने आवधिक प्रतिवेदनहरु समयमा नै पेश गर्ने तथा सन्धि कार्यान्वयन गर्ने निकायहरुबाट प्राप्त सिफारिसहरु एवं संयुक्त राष्ट्रसंघको मानव अधिकार समितिबाट पारित भएका निर्णयहरुलाई कार्ययोजना बनाई सरकारले कार्यान्वयन गरिरहेको छ । साथै राष्ट्रिय मानव अधिकार आयोगबाट प्राप्त सिफारिस एवं सम्मानित सर्वोच्च अदालतबाट भएका आदेशहरुलाई समेत सरकारले आफ्नो स्रोत साधन र क्षमता अनुसार कार्यान्वयन गरिरहेको छ । यसबाट मानव अधिकारको संस्कृति विकास गर्न उल्लेख्य टेवा पुगेको छ ।
अन्त्यमा, विश्व मानव अधिकार दिवसको अवसरले मानव अधिकारको सम्मान, संरक्षण र परिपूर्ति गर्न अझ बढी प्रतिवद्ध र क्रियाशील हुन हामी सवैलाई प्रेरणा दिएको छ । मानव अधिकारको क्षेत्रमा रहेका चुनौतिहरुलाई सामना गरी सबैको निमित्त मानव अधिकार सुनिश्चित गर्ने सरकारको योजना र प्रयासमा सहयोग पुर्‍याउन सम्पूर्ण राष्ट्रिय तथा अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय संघ/संस्था, विकासको साझेदार, मानव अधिकारकर्मीहरु लगायत सम्बद्ध सबै पक्षहरुलाई हार्दिक आग्रह गर्दछु ।
Now, may I request to all Excellences, dignitaries and representatives of diplomatic community to proceed dash for courtesy meet with Rt. Honorable President of Nepal and other dignitaries.

Statement by Hon. Dr. Prakash Sharan Mahat, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Nepal, at the Bali Democracy Forum IX
Posted onDecember 8, 2016 

“Religion, Democracy and Pluralism”
Bali, Indonesia, 8-9 December 2016

Honorable Chairperson Her Excellency Retno L.P. Marsudi, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Indonesia
Honorable Ministers and Heads of Delegations to the Bali Democracy Forum,
Excellencies and Distinguished Delegates,

Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is indeed an honour and pleasure for me to participate in the Ninth Bali Democracy Forum.
I would like to congratulate the Government of Indonesia for regularly and successfully organizing the Bali Democracy Forum which has been an effective platform for dialogue on democratic aspirations and governance since its inception in 2008.
I would like to extend my sincere gratitude for the warm hospitality extended to us. Bali offers unforgettable affection and cordiality.
I am saddened by the earthquake in Aceh yesterday killing many lives and damaging properties. I offer my deepest condolences to the affected families and express sympathy and solidarity with the people and the Government of Indonesia.

Honorable Chairperson,
The Bali Democracy Forum has been contributing to the process of institutionalization of democracy as the most prudent system of governance in the age of globalization.
This year’s theme of “Religion, Democracy and Pluralism” is indeed a thoughtful selection of topic that deserves special attention as we exchange ideas, share lessons, and assess our common aspirations.
Asia is the most diverse continent. Multiculturalism, in harmony with the nature, is what Asia offers to the world. Bali represents the Asian diversity and I believe the topic to deliberate on is a perfect choice.

Excellencies,
In Sanskrit, we call “बसुधैव कुटुम्बकम्” or “The World is One Family”. Ours is the region that is land of Buddha, Gandhi, and Confucius and many other great philosophers. We all have commitment to peace and harmony and mutual understanding.
Religion encompasses values, ethics and power for the pursuit of common good that is deeply rooted in socio-cultural tradition to strengthen civilizational bonds.
Democracy is participation with accountability that unleashes individual’s potentials and shapes up popular aspirations.
Pluralism is diversity in practice through energetic engagement and understanding to resolve differences and achieve common goals.
Revolutions and political changes give rise to popular expectation to a new height. But, resources and tools available may not be sufficient. In this context, management of expectations requires efficient, thoughtful and practical solutions.
Democracy is the best tool to deal with such challenges.
Extremism or radicalism backed by religious fundamentalism and intolerance cripples societies and destabilizes the social fabrics.
Extremism fuels instability and hinders peace and prosperity.
Nepal unequivocally condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations wherever, whenever and for whatever purposes it espouses. We call for the resolute international actions in the fight against terrorism.
Nepal attaches importance to the United Nations General Assembly resolution on “Promotion of interreligious and intercultural dialogues, understanding and cooperation for peace” as it is our obligation to promote harmony among civilizations, mutual respect, culture of peace and non-violence for maintaining human dignity and ensuring collective security.

Excellencies,
Multiculturalism is a fact of life; multiculturalism is the beauty of our diverse society. Global mobility is an unstoppable phenomenon. Although every nation has legitimate aspiration to promote national goals, deepening interconnectedness cannot be wished away by short lived ultra nationalism.
As long as our problems and challenges are common, be it global warming or terrorism, be it tsunami or earthquake, be it famine or financial crisis, we need learning from experiences.
Democracy, moderation, civilizational values, rule of law and pluralism certainly help to enrich and strengthen the bonds of international cooperation, understanding and partnership. That teaches us to compete, cooperate and converge.
The ideals, principles and processes of democracy constitute the bedrock of a just and fair international order. The importance of dialogue, democracy and development should be encouraged to define the norms of international cooperation as we embark on the implementation of 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

Honorable Chairperson,
Nepal has a time-tested history of religious harmony.
Traditional religions and faiths have made important contribution to the fabric of Nepali society. Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam as well other faiths have existed side by side and Nepal’s history is unaffected by any religious enmity or hatred.
Various cultural and religious practices have helped to strengthen the bonds of cultural harmony and become a source of inspiration to enrich diversity in unity as and when challenges face us.
Nepal’s political transformation has embraced the notion of religious harmony and creation of an egalitarian society. The values and ideals of democracy, peace, social justice and human dignity have always been guiding force for our democratic struggle.
Nepal suffered from a decade long political conflict between 1996 to 2006. It ended with the signing of the comprehensive peace accord heralding a new era of peace, democracy and inclusive development agenda.
Excellencies, Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen,
Democracy is not only about competition but also about accommodation and dialogue to reach a consensus.
Nepal’s peace process is a successful example of ending conflict through dialogue. The world can learn from Nepal to end conflicts in other parts of the world.
Since the dawn of democracy in Nepal in 1951, the people of Nepal had the aspiration of writing their constitution themselves.
The Constituent Assembly in 2008 and 2013 led the historic process of writing the constitution in a democratic, inclusive, participatory and transparent manner.
It is considered one of the most flexible and accommodative constitutions that reflects Nepal’s diversity.
We have ensured one third of the female participation in National Parliament and State Assembly as well as forty percent at the local bodies. Currently, we have President of the Country, Speaker of the Parliament and Chief Justice of the Supreme Court all headed by women.

Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen,
An inclusive and robust development path is the priority for the present Government of Nepal. Empowerment of the women, the poor and the marginalized groups of people is critical to ensure their participation in development and to promote social justice and shared prosperity for all.
The Government of Nepal is now planning to hold local, provincial and federal elections in accordance with the constitutional arrangements that would ensure democratic exercise contributing to sustainable peace and inclusive development in the country.
Our democratic transition has become a unique example of people-led movement for democracy in the quest for peace and inclusive development.

Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen,
Religious, ethnic and political intolerance continue to exist at the global level and in many places even increasing. There is no substitute to religious harmony, democracy and plural values. Let us collectively work against forces of intolerance.
Once again, I appreciate the initiative of the Bali Democracy Forum for advancing the cause of democratic consolidation through learning from each other.
I thank you all for your kind attention.

———————————————
Mr. Chairman
Your Excellency Shri Pranab Mukherjee, President of India,
Distinguished Guests,
Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I would like to thank, at the outset, Niti Anusandhan Pratisthan and India Foundation for inviting me at this important seminar organized on the occasion of the State Visit of His Excellency Shri Pranab Mukherjee, President of India. While the seminar is highly significant for its most relevant theme, its value is further enhanced by the kind presence ofHis Excellency President of India.It is indeed agreat honour for me to speak on Nepal-India relations in front ofthis august gathering.
Excellency, you are a statesman and a scholar of high stature with decades of experience in politics. A very close friend of Nepal and Nepali people, the contributions you have made to further strengthening Nepal-India relations in various capacities have been well recognized. I look forward to listening to the insights and ideas that you will share with us at this seminar and Iam confident those insights willhelp elevate Nepal-India relations to new heights.
Excellencies, 
Ladies and Gentlemen,
As is well-known and long-established, Nepal and India share a unique relationship. Our relations are not only age-old, they are also time tested, comprehensive, deep and multi-dimensional. Geography, culture, religion, history and fraternal bonds intimately bind our peoples together. The open border between our countries facilitates movement of people, goods and services, and it has contributed to maintain the warmth of relations and cultural connections at peoples’ level. While the two governments have their own formal treaties and mechanisms to define our formal relations, the relations between the two countries are also defined by the multi-faceted relations that our peoples have shared from the times before modern political boundaries were drawn.
Oftentimes, people ask me to compare Nepal-India relations.Given the nature, scope and merit of our relations, there is no need to compare our relations with any other relationship.
What more can we say about Nepal-India relations as many Nepali political leaders and activists had participated in India’s freedom struggle, and at the same time Indian leaders supported our quest for democracy in Nepal. Hundreds of thousands of Nepali are working in India in different capacities. Large number of Indians are also working in Nepal in the business and other occupations. Two countries have open border and people of both countries can enter one another’s’ territory without passport or visa requirements.
India was the first country to send relief and rescue teams within hours of the devastating earthquake that hit Nepal eighteen months ago.  The promptness and generosity with which India responded to our difficulties was extraordinary, truly reflecting the closeness of our relationship.  India has also provided substantial funding for reconstruction. We sincerely thank for this help.
With the uniqueness of our relations there come expectations from both sides. As we have complex web of multi- faceted relationships occasional differences bound to occur. Such differences however, cannot and should not undermine the solid foundation of our relationship.And, our relation is resilient enough to overcome those challenges. In the recent past too, we experienced problems, but we were quick enough to realize that there was no alternative to look for solution, sort the problem out and move forward. We believe that with open heart and mind, any differences can be resolved through dialogue.
This is what the present government is doing. We are following a policy where Nepal is straight forward and frankly stating what needs to be done at diplomatic table.We have also seen very positive gestures during our several high-level interactions with Indian leaderships. We firmly believe that we should refrain from mixing issues of foreign relations with internal partisan politics.This government in general and my Party Nepali Congress in particular is very clear about it. I believe it is harmful for our own national interest.
Stable political relationship founded on enhanced level of trust and confidence, mutually beneficial and cooperative economic engagement, and common approach to address common challenges should be the basic tenets of Nepal-India partnership for coming years. We should not hesitate to share one another’s concerns as friends do and also appreciate one another’ssensitivities and seek ways to work in concert.
Let me elaborate on some of the important areas of Nepal India relations.
Firstly, a strong foundation of Nepal-India relationships should rest on the mutual belief that both countries should work through diplomatic channels at different levelsin order to ensure progress in all agreed areas and resolvewhen differencesarise. We should make all bilateral mechanismsfunctional to deal with issues important to both countries.In this regard, we are committed and have already started to streamline and operationalize modalities to deal with such issues.At the same time, we have agreed to implement bilateral cooperation projects in a time bound fashion.Both countries have agreed to constitute bilateral mechanisms to monitor implementation status of the agreements and the progress of Indian-supported projects in Nepal.
Secondly, we need to revisit our past treaties, their provisions and relevance in the changing context. We have already agreed to do so and come up with proposals which are agreeable to both countries. The Eminent Persons Group(EPG)is working to look into different aspects our relations and provide concrete suggestions on measures to be taken in future for the betterment of our relations.
Thirdly, there are some issues unique to Nepalbasically arising from Nepal’sland-locked condition and asymmetric economic capacity.We havea very low industrial base,limited productive capacity, under- developed physical infrastructures, and under- tapped natural resources.
Excellencies,
Ladies and gentlemen,
Trade and transits are vital component of Nepal-India bilateral relations. India is our top trading partner in terms of both export and import while Nepal is among India’s top twenty export destination. Nepal’s growing trade deficit is a matter of concern for us. Our import volume form India is thirteen times higher than our exports, if you see the figure of the first quarter of this year. To address this imbalance, there is a need for greater investment in productive sectors in Nepal, greater trade facilitation measures, including abolition of non-tariff and para tariff barriers and robust connectivity between two countries in terms of roads, railways, waterways, transmission ways and information highways.
‘Make in India’ is one of the flagship initiatives of Prime Minister Modiji in driving Indian economy forward. Given our close economic interconnection, why do we not think of extending the idea of ‘Make in India’ to ‘Make in India and Nepal’ initiativethrough joint collaboration and enabling Nepal to participate in value chain.
It is encouraging that two countries are working towards developing greater cross-border connectivity to promote trade, tourism and investment. We have agreed to speed up cross border railway projects, integrated check posts at major border points as well as additional transmission connectivity. Much remains to be done, however, to fully realize our development potential and partnership.
Hydropower development is the area that promises great opportunities for collaboration. We have not been able to fully exploit our large hydro power potential despite the pressing need of clean renewable energy in both countries. We cannot afford this resource go unutilized any more. Effective implementation of the Power Trade Agreement, early realization of Pancheshwor Multipurpose Project and timely development of two large hydro power projects namely Upper Karnali and Arun III projects will be instrumental in ensuring mutually beneficial partnership between our two countries.
Large hydro-power development in Nepal requires markets of India and Bangladesh to realize its full potential.The free market access is a prerequisite for this. We have requested government of India to remove some of the regulatory hurdles to enhance market access and India has assured that required new regulation and guidelines to liberalize cross border trade of electricity will be operationalized soon. It will provide big boost to larger hydropower investment in Nepal. Tangible realization of BBIN cooperation including open access to transmission infrastructure and market within the sub-region will create a further enabling environment.
We should also seriously work together to come up with an umbrella framework for cost and benefit- sharingin joint undertaking of mega multipurpose water resource projects like Pancheshwar.Such framework would help ensure a more smooth and speedy proceeding in future joint multipurpose projects.
Nepal and India also need to work closely in managing and reducing problem of inundation. Recent meeting of Nepal-India Joint Commission has agreed to identify specific locations of inundation and undertake joint inspection and resolve the problem of inundation.
The Joint Commission also agreed to implement Pancheswar project, expediting the finalization of its DPR. The mechanism also agreed to implement irrigation facilities to Nepal that were provided in Mahakali and Gandak treaties.
The early undertaking of remaining boundary mapping will remove some of the recurring misunderstandings between two countries. I am pleased to note that in the sectors of the Nepal-India international boundary where scientific mapping has been accomplished, all technical works like pillar construction and GPS referencing are moving in satisfactory manner.It is, therefore, imperative that both governments should take initiative to resolve the mapping issue in the remaining stretches of Nepal-India boundary.
Excellencies,
Ladies and gentlemen,
Technology is the key for innovation and transformation. India, equipped with the modern technology, has established itself as a leading force in driving development. Nepal aspires to benefit from India’s technological expertise and innovation. Transfer of knowledge and technology along with capital investment will enable us to accelerate the pace of economic development with increased employment opportunities that is essential to eradicate poverty.
Despite its zero contribution to carbon emissions, Nepal is at risk of major climatic change that is contributing to melting of glaciers and ices. The climate change impact on Himalayas is going to affect both Nepal and India. As signatory to reduce growth of global warming, both countries can work together to mitigate and adapt to the impact of climate change.
The common civilization and strong cultural bonds also offer us a good prospect for the development of tourism.Nepal is renowned for its great natural beauty and its treasures of cultural heritage. There are a number of cultural and religious sites common to our people in both countries.Nepal being the birth-place of Lord Buddha and Mata Sita as well as the existence of ancient religious-cultural heritages and shrines like Pashupatinath, Ram Janaki temple, Lumbini and Muktinath, it provides a great potential for cultural-religious tourism. Cultural tourism can be promoted by developing Hindu and Buddhist circuits.
Our open border has facilitated movement of people and goods and services. However, both countries are cognizant that our security concerns and interests are interlinked. We are, therefore, working together and in close coordination to overcome our common security challenges like cross border crimes and human and drug trafficking and illegal activities of different nature.In the meantime, we have remained watchful not to allow the open border to be misused by elements posing security threats.The work is progressing in the construction of integrated check posts.
Nepal has its principled position against terrorism in any form and manifestation. We expressed our solidarity with the Government and people of India in the wake of repeated terrorist attacks in India and condemned such attacks in strongest possible terms. We believe that in the shadow of insecurity and terror our region cannot prosper in a sustainable manner.We should work together against the growing menace of terrorism through global and regional forums.
Nepal and India still lag behind many countries in development dividends. We should work together in international and regional forums to advance the cause of developing countries in areas such as trade, investment, poverty reduction, climate change and sustainable development.
As source countries for large number of migrant workers mainly in gulf regions both countries should work together for their security and safety.We should also enhance our cooperation to check human trafficking and illegal activities of different natures.
There is rapid advance in information and other technological advances. In the changing context, our collaboration requires dynamism that can move with changing needs.
Excellencies,
Ladies and gentlemen,
Nepal has been able to bring out an inclusive and democratic constitution which has many unique features appreciated at the international level, and that sets good examples for others to draw on from it. However, as any democratic constitution, there are still scopes for improvement, and we are working to address some of the remaining grievances through constitutional amendment. We have already made an amendment once. At the same time, we can learn from India’s successful institutionalization of democratic constitutional practices.
In many difficult and challenging times in the past, India supported the Nepali people with utmost goodwill. Now, at a time when Nepali people are engaged in noble mission of achieving a fully democratic, just, inclusive and prosperous society through the effective implementation of the democratic Constitution, it is natural that Nepal expects goodwill, support and cooperation from the people and Government of India.
Nepal and India are members of sub-regional grouping BBIN and regional groupings SAARC and BIMSTEC. This offers opportunities for both countries to meaningfully cooperate in areas of mutual interest that could compliment bilateral cooperation. Likewise, our both countries could intensify cooperation together with other developing countries in addressing some of the pressing global challenges and in advancing the common interest of the developing world.
Mr. Chairman
Our two countries face such common challenges as terrorism, climate change, and challenges related to uplifting large masses of people out of poverty. Common challenges requirecoordinated response. Our two countries strongly call for reform in the United Nations and other international institutions to reflect the current realities. As the largest democracy in the world, India has an important role to play in global affairs. Nepal supports India’s legitimate aspirations and therefore we supported India’ aspiration to become permanent member of UN Security council.
In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, I would like to underline the following:

As close neighbours, our destiny is intertwined. Common prosperity becomes an overriding goal. Poverty stands as a stumbling block in our road to prosperity. To eradicate it, there is no alternative to cooperation and collaboration.


We must be innovative and creative in exploring new vistas and opportunities consistent with the trends of our time, as business as usual model will not suffice. We should be able to take advantage of innovation and advancement in science and technology to accelerate our development process.


Our multidimensional relations demand greater collaboration and partnership between and among the private sectors, media, intellectuals, professionals, parliamentarians and non-governmental organizations. They all have important roles to play in cementing ties.


Infrastructures and connectivity should remain at the core of our collaborative partnership without which development cannot advance.


Equality, mutual benefit, respect for eachothers’ sensitivities and concerns should in no way be undermined as foundation of our friendly relations. We have common responsibility to preserve our relationship handed down through ages.

Thank you once again for the opportunity provided to speak a few words at this seminar.

भारतको गोवामा सम्पन्न ‘ब्रिक्स बिमस्टेक आउटरिच शिखर सम्मेलन’मा सहभागी भई स्वदेश फिर्ति पश्‍चात् सम्माननीय प्रधानमन्त्री श्री पुष्प कमल दाहाल ‘प्रचण्ड’ले त्रिभुवन अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय विमानस्थलमा सञ्चारकर्मीहरूलाई गर्नुभएको सम्बोधन।
प्रेस नोट
उपस्थित सञ्चारकर्मी साथीहरू,
मित्रराष्ट्र भारतका प्रधानमन्त्री महामहिम श्री नरेन्द्र मोदीले आठौँ ब्रिक्स शिखर सम्मेलनको अवसर पारेर यही असोज ३० मा आयोजना गर्नुभएको ‘ब्रिक्स-बिमस्टेक आउटरिच सम्मेलन’मा सहभागी भई आज स्वदेश फर्केको छु।
मेरो प्रतिनिधिमण्डलमा माननीय परराष्ट्रमन्त्री डा. प्रकाश शरण महत, परराष्ट्र सचिव, प्रधानमन्त्री तथा मन्त्रिपरिषद् कार्यालयका सचिव लगायतका अधिकारीहरू सहभागी रहनुभएको यहाँहरूलाई जानकारी नै छ।प्रतिनिधिमण्डलमा सहभागी सञ्चारकर्मी मित्रहरुबाट नियमित समाचार सम्प्रेषण भइरहेकै हुँदा यहाँहरु गोवामा भएका कार्यक्रमहरु तथा द्विपक्षीय भेटघाटका बारे सुसूचित नै हुनुहुन्छ।
तिब्र आर्थिक विकासका कारण विश्वमञ्चमा उदियमान शक्तिका रूपमा परिचित पाँच मुलुकहरूको समूह ब्रिक्सको बार्षिक शिखर सम्मेलनका समयमा आतिथ्य मुलुक संलग्न क्षेत्रीय समूहसंग सम्वाद गरी साझा हित र साझेदारीका क्षेत्र पहिल्याउने अभ्यास केही बर्षयता प्रचलनमा रहेको छ। सोही अभ्यासको निरन्तरताको रूपमा भारतमा यसबर्ष ब्रिक्स र बिमस्टेक समूहका एघार मुलुकका राष्ट्र प्रमूख/सरकार प्रमूख सम्मिलित ‘आउटरिच शिखर सम्मेलन’को आयोजना भएको हो।
सम्मेलनमा ब्रिक्स समूहका उदियमान आर्थिक शक्तिहरू तथा बिमस्टेक समूहका विकासशिल एवं अल्पविकसित मुलुकहरूबिच साझा हित र समृद्धिका प्राप्तिका दिशामा के कस्तो साझेदारी गर्न सकिन्छ भन्ने बिषयमा शिर्ष नेतृत्व तहमा घनिभूत एवं खुलस्त छलफल भयो। ‘आउटरिच शिखर सम्मेलन’को मूल बिषय ‘अवसरहरूको साझेदारी’ रहेको थियो। बिमस्टेक समूहको वर्तमान अध्यक्षको हैसियतले ‘आउटरिच शिखर सम्मेलन’मा नेपालको सहभागिता महत्वपूर्ण रह्यो।
‘आउटरिच शिखर सम्मेलन’लाई सम्बोधन गर्ने क्रममा मैले ब्रिक्स समूहका विकासशील मुलुकहरुले आर्थिक, सामाजिक, गरिबि निवारण, विज्ञान तथा प्रविधि लगायत अन्य विविध क्षेत्रमा हासिल गरेको उच्च प्रगतिबाट बिमस्टेक समूहका विकासशील एवं अल्पविकसित मुलुकहरूले लाभ लिने वातावरण श्रृजना गरिनुपर्ने कुरामा जोड दिएँ। पछिल्ला बर्षहरूमा ब्रिक्स मुलुकहरू वैदेशिक लगानी भित्र्याउने प्रतिस्पर्धामा मात्र अगाडि नभई विश्वका अन्य मुलुकले प्राप्त गर्ने वाह्य लगानीको महत्वपुर्ण श्रोतका रूपमा देखा परेको परिप्रेक्ष्यमा विमस्टेक क्षेत्रमा हुने बढी भन्दा बढी लगानी ब्रिक्स बिमस्टेक साझेदारीको महत्वपुर्ण पाटो हुनुपर्ने बिषय मैले उठाएँ। यसै सन्दर्भमा गत बर्ष संचालनमा आएको ब्रिक्सको ‘नयाँ विकास बैंक’मार्फत बिमस्टेक क्षेत्रमा पूर्वाधार विकास एवं दिगो विकासका लक्ष्य प्राप्तिसंग सम्बन्धित प्राथमिकताका क्षेत्रमा लगानीको श्रोत परिचालन हुनुपर्ने बिषय मैले उठाएँ।
ब्रिक्स मुलुकहरूले द्रूत आर्थिक प्रगति हासिल गर्नका लागि अवलम्वन गरेका उपायहरू विकासशील मूलुकको सन्दर्भमा सफल प्रमाणित भइसकेको सन्दर्भमा त्यस्ता उपायहरूको प्रयोग बिमस्टेक लगायत अन्य विकासशील मुलुकहरूका लागि लाभदायक हुने विचार राख्दै मैले दुई समूहबिच मानव विकास, कृषि प्रविधि तथा आधुनिकिकरण, उर्जा उत्पादन तथा प्रयोग, विश्व शान्ति तथा स्थिरता जस्ता बिषयहरूमा साझेदारी विकास गर्न सकिने कुरा प्रष्ट पारेँ।
ब्रिक्स-बिमस्टेक आउटरिच सम्मेलनअघी भारतीय प्रधानमन्त्रीले बिमस्टेक राष्ट्र/सरकार प्रमूख सम्मिलित रिट्रिट बैठकको आयोजना गर्नुभयो। दुई गतिशील क्षेत्र दक्षिण एशिया तथा दक्षिण पूर्व एशिया जोड्ने क्षेत्रीय सहयोग संयन्त्रको रूपमा स्थापित बिमस्टेकभित्र क्षेत्रीय सहयोग कसरी थप सघन बनाउने भन्ने बारे गोवामा सदस्य मुलुकका शिर्ष नेतृत्वबिच उपयोगी छलफल भयो। बिमस्टेक रिट्रिट बैठकको अन्त्यमा बिमस्टेकका प्राथमिकताका बिषयहरू समेटिएको एक घोषणापत्र (Outcome document) जारी भयो। सो दस्ताबेज तपाईँहरुको हातमा परिसकेको छ भन्ने विश्वास लिएको छु। घोषणापत्र परराष्ट्र मन्त्रालयको वेवसाइटमा पनि उपलब्ध छ।
रिट्रिट बैठकलाई सम्बोधन गर्दै मैले क्षेत्रीय कनेक्टिभिटि, उर्जा विकास, व्यापार तथा पारवहन, सांस्कृतिक क्षेत्रमा सहयोग एवं जनस्तरको सम्बन्धको वृद्धि जस्ता बिषयमा जोड दिएँ। आगामी बर्ष बिमस्टेक स्थापनाको २०औं बर्षगाँठ पारेर हामीले बिमस्टेक शिखर सम्मेलन नेपालमा आयोजना गर्न चाहेको बारे सदस्य मुलुकहरूलाई जानकारी गराएँ।
दुई बहुपक्षीय कार्यक्रमका अतिरिक्त शिखर सम्मेलनका समयमा भारतका महामहिम प्रधानमन्त्री, चीनका महामहिम राष्ट्रपति, श्रीलंकाका महामहिम राष्ट्रपति एवम् भुटानका महामहिम प्रधानमन्त्रीसंग द्विपक्षीय भेटघाट तथा कुराकानी गर्ने अवसर प्राप्त भयो।
भारतका प्रधानमन्त्री महामहिम श्री नरेन्द्र मोदीसंगको कुराकानीमा हामीले द्विपक्षीय सहयोगमा सञ्चालित परियोजनाहरूलाई समयबद्ध रूपमा सम्पन्न गर्नमा ध्यान दिनुपर्ने बिषयलाई जोड दियौँ। भारतका महामहिम राष्ट्रपतिले निकट भविष्यमा गर्नुहुने नेपाल भ्रमणको कार्यक्रमका बारे छलफल गर्‍यौँ। साथै दुईपक्षीय सहयोगमा सञ्चालित परियोजनाहरुको प्रगति अनुगमन गर्न गत महिना भएको मेरो भारत भ्रमणको समयमा सहमति भएअनुसार दुवै सरकारका प्रतिनिधि रहने संयन्त्र गठनको कार्य चाँडै टुंग्याउने बारे समेत कुराकानी भयो।नेपाल भारत सम्बन्धका विविध विषयमा छिट्टै आयोजना हुन गईरहेको नेपाल भारत संयुक्त आयोगको चौथो बैठकमा विस्तृत समिक्षा हुने भएको छ।
चीनका राष्ट्रपति महामहिम सी जिनपीङसंगको भेटमा हामीले पञ्चशीलको सिद्दान्तमा आधारित मित्रवत् सम्बन्धको बारेमा चर्चा गर्‍यौँ।। दुईदेशीय सहयोगात्मक सम्बन्धलाई थप गहन बनाउने दिशामा हामीले विगतमा भएका समझदारी र सम्झौताको पूर्ण कार्यान्वयन गर्नुपर्ने बिषयमा जोड दियौँ। दुईदेशीय सम्बन्धलाई थप सुदृढ बनाउने उच्चस्तरीय भ्रमणको महत्वमा जोड दिँदै चिनिया राष्ट्रपतिलाई नेपालको भ्रमण गर्न मैले पुनः अनुरोध गरेँ। उहाँले आफू नेपाल भ्रमण गर्न इच्छुक रहेको बताउँदै यथाशिघ्र भ्रमणमा आउने जानकारी दिनुभयो।
श्रीलंकाका राष्ट्रपति महामहिम मैथ्रिपाला सिरिसेनासँगको कुराकानीमा हामीले दुवै देशकाबिच बिषेशगरि सांस्कृतिक सम्बन्ध एवं हवाई सम्पर्क बढाउनुपर्नेमा जोड दियौँ। साथै क्षेत्रीय सहयोगको प्रबर्द्धन र आपसी हितका विषयमा वहाँसँग मैत्रिपूर्ण वातावरणमा कुराकानी भयो।
भुटानका प्रधानमन्त्री महामहिम छेरिन तोब्गेसंगको भेटमा हामीले हिमालयको काखमा रहेका दुई मूलुकबिच साझा चासोका विविध क्षेत्रमा आपसि सहयोग वृद्धि गर्ने सम्बन्धमा कुराकानि गर्‍यौँ।साथै नेपालमा रहेका भुटानी शरणार्थी समस्या शिघ्र समाधान गर्नु पर्ने विषयमा पनि भुटानी प्रधानमन्त्रीसँग कुराकानी भयो।
औपचारिक कार्यक्रमका अतिरिक्त सम्मेलनका समयमा ब्रिक्स एवं बिमस्टेक सदस्य मुलुकका राष्ट्र/सरकार प्रमूखहरुसंग अनौपचारिक भेटघाट गर्ने र सम्बन्ध पुनर्ताजगी गर्ने अवसर हामीलाई प्राप्त भयो।
चीनका राष्ट्रपतिसँगको ‌औपचारिक भेटवार्तापछी होटेल फर्कने क्रममा प्राविधिक कारणले केही समय प्रतिक्षाकक्षमा रहँदा चीनका राष्ट्रपतिसँग कुराकानी गर्ने अवसर प्राप्त भयो। केही समय पछी भारतका प्रधानमन्त्री पनि सोही कक्षमा प्रवेश गर्नुभयो। यसलाई एउटा सुखद संयोग मान्‍नुपर्छ कि मैले उक्त अवसरमा हाम्रा छिमेकी मित्रराष्ट्रहरुका उच्च राजनीतिक नेतृत्वसँग त्रिदेशीय हितका पक्षमा मिलेर काम गर्ने सम्बन्धमा आफ्ना बिचारहरु राख्ने मौका पाएँ र वहाँहरुले पनि यसलाई सकारात्मक रुपमा लिनुभयो।यो सकारात्मक पक्ष हो र यसलाई हामीले त्यही अर्थमा बुझ्नुपर्छ। यो कुनै पूर्व निर्धारित कार्यक्रम भने थिएन।
त्यसै गरी, गोवामा रहँदा दक्षिण अफ्रिकाका राष्ट्रपति महामहिम श्री ज्याकोब जुमासँग भेट भई द्विपक्षीय सम्बन्ध र शान्ति प्रक्रियाको अनुभवका विषयमा कुराकानी भयो। नेपालमा आवासीय राजदूतावास खोल्ने विषयमा दक्षिण अफ्रिकाका राष्ट्रपतिले सकारात्मक रुपमा विचार गर्ने जानकारी दिनुभयो।
समग्रमा हाम्रो दुईदिने गोवा बसाई उपयोगी रहेको महशुस गरेको छु।
धन्यबाद।

Remarks by The Rt. Hon’ble Pushpa Kamal Dahal “Prachanda’ at the BRICS-BIMSTEC Outreach Summit, Goa, India, 16 October 2016
Posted onOctober 16, 2016October 16, 2016 

His Excellency Shri Narendra Modi, Prime Minister of India,
 Excellencies Leaders of BRICS and BIMSTEC member states,
 Ladies and Gentlemen:
I congratulate Prime Minister Modiji and the Government of India for successfully hosting the 8th BRICS Summit.
I extend sincere thanks to the Prime Minister of India for convening this Outreach Summit. This event is a unique opportunity of dialogue between the two vibrant groupings of nations.
As we assemble here, one of our fellow BIMSTEC member, Thailand, is mourning the demise of His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej. I express heartfelt condolences and sympathies to the Royal Thai Government and friendly people of Thailand at this hour of grief.
While BRICS represents more than a third of world’s population and over a quarter of global GDP, BIMSTEC stands for the collective aspirations of over 1.5 billion people for development and a better future.
While BRICS has been a center of gravity for growth and economic transformation, BIMSTEC possesses tremendous potentials to emerge as increasingly vibrant region.
This provides an impetus for collaborative partnership between BRICS and BIMSTEC. India, as a common member in both, can play a bridging role.
 
Excellencies,
For us, BRICS members offer inspiring models of developmental transformation. Freeing millions of people out of the vicious cycle of poverty in the past two decades was undoubtedly an extraordinary accomplishment for BRICS.
From human development to manifold upturn of people’s per capita income; from critical infrastructure to upswing of trade and FDI, BRICS continue to achieve what was once beyond imagination. BRICS’ sustained growth helped stabilize world economy even during the worst economic and financial crisis.
We see BRICS’ rise as an opportunity. The biggest advantage of learning from the good practices of BRICS members is that their developmental tools and measures are tested in the unique developing country context.
BIMSTEC members are a home to nearly a fifth of world’s humanity, endowed with abundant natural resources and boundless capacity to grow.
We have close geographic linkage and share many cultural and civilizational ethos. For over a decade, we are working together for better lives and livelihoods of our peoples. BIMSTEC’s priorities largely converge with those of BRICS.
Excellencies,
This is the first time BRICS and BIMSTEC are deliberating on partnership in opportunities. Possibility of working together is immense.
In larger forums, we can better coordinate our views in global norm setting including through the reform in the global governance architecture reflective of current realities.
BRICS countries today are not only the prime locus of inbound global FDI but also the ever-enlarging source of outbound investment. As fellow developing countries and the countries in immediate neighbourhood of two important BRICS members, BIMSTEC members have a natural expectation that they receive greater share of FDI from BRICS countries. This will further deepen partnership.
Cooperation in education and human development could be beneficial to both groups. Demographic dividend is an asset for both. Large youthful population in our countries can be a force for transformation. But we need to focus on their development.
Our countries are at different stages of technological capacity and innovation index. BRICS countries possess state of the art technologies and some of them have emerged as technology leaders. This points to the possibility of promoting cooperation and sharing the benefits of technology.
Despite some progress in recent years, our countries are still the biggest concentration of world poverty in term of absolute number of poor. We can share with each other anti-poverty schemes that have effectively worked.
Agriculture is the mainstay of economy for most of us. BRICS members have made tremendous progress in transforming the traditional agricultural pattern into a modern technology-based economic sector. From this many of us can learn and benefit.
Cooperation in the field of energy is critical and can be a game changer in our socio-economic development landscape provided we develop a right energy mix. Greater use of renewable energy can contribute to clean and green development. Some of us have immense potentiality to generate renewable energy. If harnessed properly, others in neighbourhood can benefit as well.
State of the art infrastructure will provide us the much-needed physical foundation for closer intra-regional connectivity. Connectivity in all forms (roads, railways, waterways, airways and transmission ways) facilitates movement of goods, services and people. The importance of physical connectivity particularly for landlocked countries is vital. Such connectivity needs to be complemented by other forms of connectivity – be that in terms of knowledge, ideas, technology or finance.
We congratulate the BRICS for the establishment and successful operationalization of the New Development Bank. The Bank can serve as an important source of funding infrastructure projects and programmes for sustainable development prioritized by BIMSTEC.
Excellencies,
We have common stake in successful realization of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Least developed countries should receive special support measures so that they are not left behind in this process.
We must collectively fight against the threat of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, human and drug trafficking and other trans-national crimes.
I conclude by thanking once again the Government of India and Prime Minister Modiji for organizing this Summit. I am fully convinced that broadened and deepened partnership between BRICS and BIMSTEC would not only be supportive to our economic progress but also contribute to building peaceful and prosperous societies.
Our partnership should contribute to eradicate poverty from our regions by fully unleashing our respective potentials.
Our partnership should be rewarding and beneficial for all of us and contribute to enable us to grow and prosper together.
Our partnership should contribute to strengthen global peace and stability.
Our partnership should contribute to enhance our standing on the global stage.
Our partnership should make sure that none of us is left behind.
Thank you.

Statement by The Rt. Hon’ble Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’, Prime Minister of Nepal at the BIMSTEC Leaders’ Retreat, Goa, India, 16 October 2016
Posted onOctober 16, 2016October 16, 2016 

 
Your Excellency Shri Narendra Modiji, Prime Minister of India
Fellow leaders from BIMSTEC member states
Secretary General of BIMSTEC 
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I am pleased to attend the BIMSTEC Leaders’ Retreat in this beautiful city of Goa.
I thank Prime Minister Modiji for this opportunity and admire his leadership in taking this initiative.
Thank you, Prime Minister, for the kind invitation, warm hospitality and excellent arrangements made for the Retreat.
At the outset let me offer my heartfelt condolences and sympathies on the sad demise of His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej, King of Thailand. We stand by the friendly people of Thailand at this hour of profound grief.
Excellencies,
BIMSTEC member states are connected by cultures, history and geography.  This commonality provides a strong foundation and motivation for cooperation.
BIMSTEC connects two vibrant regions of Asia, South East Asia and South Asia. Development potentials of this grouping are huge. With over 1.5 billion of population and combined GDP of US $2.5 trillion, this region can be a dynamic engine of growth and development.
The potential of this grouping cannot be unleashed without advancing integration. The engine of growth and development cannot perform in full capacity without   intensifying cooperation. And BIMSTEC provides that vital platform for integration and cooperation.
Connectivity in all forms must be pursued with topmost priority.  For a landlocked country like ours the importance of physical connectivity, among others, cannot be overemphasized.
Energy cooperation should be directed towards ensuring energy security for all of us. Region’s diverse sources of energy could be harnessed to establish a reliable energy mix for the region. Nepal offers huge renewable energy sources in terms of hydropower.
Cooperation on trade, investment and other matters on economic agenda must advance urgently.  Without progress on core areas, deeper integration will prove to be an elusive quest.
We need to expedite negotiations for concluding agreements on trade in goods, trade in services, mutual assistance in customs matters, among others.
We need to level up the playing field to ensure that opportunities and fruits of development will be shared by all the member states.
We need to put agriculture on high priority in our cooperation framework. Nepal, as the lead country on Poverty Alleviation, remains committed to bring tangible progress in this sector.
Establishment of BIMSTEC Buddhist Circuit and BIMSTEC Heritage Sites will be important initiatives to promote people-to-people contacts and tourism.
Progress in technological and human resources development is equally critical.
Excellencies,
Unfortunately, our region is not free from challenges. We continue to face a multitude of problems. Threat of terrorism and extremism is serious and is testing our will and ability.
We must fight these evils resolutely and unreservedly. Acts of terrorism cannot be condoned on any ground.
Growing phenomenon of non-communicable diseases; spread of pandemic diseases; increased food insecurity, adverse impact of natural disasters and climate change have made our development journey extremely difficult.
However, these challenges are conquerable. Our collective will and concerted effort can overwhelm these problems. Strengthened partnership and collaboration can overcome these hurdles.
Excellencies,
In the last two decades of BIMSTEC journey, we have made some progress. However, we have to acknowledge this fact –our progress has not matched our potentials; our progress has remained well below our expectation.
Responsibility is ours:
to overcome the causes of inadequate performance and accelerate the process of integration;
to make this region a region of development, peace and prosperity; and
to decimate poverty, hunger and backwardness.
Responsibility is ours:
to make this region a region of initiatives as well as achievements; and
to ensure simultaneous widening and deepening of cooperation.
We must, therefore, set a clear vision for the next 20 years or so. Our vision must be underpinned by our firm commitment and concrete actions. We need a realistic and outcome oriented action plan to give practical meaning to our vision.
It is imperative that we constitute an Eminent Persons Group for this purpose and devise our vision in line with the UN 2030 Agenda including Sustainable Development Goals.
Before concluding, I would like to acknowledge the active role being played by the Secretary General and his team in coordinating and facilitating BIMSTEC process and activities.
While endorsing the outcome document of the Retreat, we are confident that the document will contribute immensely to the substantive preparation of the Fourth BIMSTEC Summit in 2017, for which we are eagerly waiting to welcome you in Kathmandu.
Thank you.

Statement by Hon. Foreign Minister of Nepal at UNGA-71
Posted onSeptember 25, 2016 

Statement by Hon. Dr. Prakash Sharan Mahat,  Minister for Foreign Affairs and  Head of the Nepali delegation to the 71st Session of the United Nations General Assembly 
 New York, 24 September 2016
 
Mr. President,

I wish to begin by congratulating you on your election to the presidency of the 71st session of the General Assembly of the United Nations.
I assure you of my delegation’s full support in the successful discharge of your important responsibilities.
Let me also commend outgoing President His Excellency Mr. Mogens Lykketoft for his effective leadership of the previous session.
I wish to place on record Nepal’s admiration to His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, Secretary General, for the dedication with which he served the world body for the last 10 years. And we wish him well for the future.

Mr. President,
Exactly six decades ago, Nepal first spoke at the 11th session of the General Assembly as a newly admitted member.
Sixty years down the road, our commitment to the United Nations have become even stronger. The principles of the UN Charter remain at the core of Nepal’s foreign policy.
As much as United Nations has contributed to our development endeavors and lately to the peace process, Nepal has significantly contributed to the United Nations in fulfilling its primary responsibility of maintaining international peace and security.

Mr. President,
 It has been a year since we adopted the universal and transformative 2030 Agenda with the objective of leaving no one behind.
One year on, it is clear now that much more needs to be done to move from commitments to results.
Let me stress the fact that the secure foundation of the world peace rests on wellbeing of the people across the globe. Poverty reduction and sustainable development are thus inseparable. We cannot imagine a peaceful, prosperous and secure society when millions of people are living in poverty.

I, thus, urge all member states and our development partners to move beyond rhetoric and commence concrete actions without losing time, energy and zeal.
We have also realized that SDGs can only be realized if sound development policies and frameworks are backed by capable institutional framework, adequate resources, and innovative methods of implementation.
As much as the national commitment, ownership, leadership and people-centric governance are critical in the domestic context, robust international partnership is equally important to ensure SDGs’ success.
We would thus like to see progress in all pillars of resources- ODA, trade, FDI, technology and debt relief – to ensure smooth implementation of SDG agenda.
In case of Nepal, our commitment to SDGs is informed by our success in MDGs.
Amidst multiple challenges, Nepal’s performance on the Millennium Development Goals were impressive.
We were able to halve the proportion of people living in poverty. We were also able to significantly reduce the maternal and infant mortality rates. We were able to send more children to schools and retain them. Participation of girls was substantially increased.
SDG agenda is now a part of our national development plans and programs. We will implement it with utmost priority.

Mr. President,
The vision for a safer world continues to elude us.
New sources of threats to humanity have emerged while at the same time the traditional sources of threats become more pronounced. The modes and intensity of non-traditional security threats, such as terrorism, transnational crimes, ethnic tensions and intra-state conflicts, and violent extremism have increased manifold.
Abuse of innovation in information and communications technology by criminal elements has further engendered vulnerability of societies.
We underline the central role of the UN General Assembly and the Security Council in addressing these threats and challenges.
The growing terrorist activities in our own region and in many parts of the world are a matter of serious concern for all of us. Terrorism is a serious threat to human quest to live in harmony, peace and dignity.
Nepal unequivocally condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.
The failure of the international community to agree on a comprehensive convention on international terrorism is highly frustrating. We call upon the international community to muster much needed political will to accomplish this agenda.
To create a secure world, we must adopt two-track approach.
First, we deal with emerging threats resolutely, firmly and collectively. On a much broader scale, we also need to nurture the culture of peace.
As the birth place of Lord Buddha, Nepal believes that meaningful exchanges and dialogues among civilizations would help embed the values, contributing eventually to the world peace.
 
Mr. President,
We would like to see an early resolution of conflict in Syria. The suffering of the Syrian people must come to an end.
Nepal supports the call for a just, lasting and comprehensive peace in the Middle East. We recognize the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people for an independent state based on UN resolutions and the right of every nation in the region to live in peace within secure and recognized international boundaries.

Mr. President,
Nepal stands for complete and time-bound disarmament of all weapons of mass destruction, including the nuclear ones.
An environment must be created for the realization of development dividends of disarmament by redirecting scarce resources for productive use.
The global community, especially the nuclear states, must put sincere efforts for moving forward the stalled negotiations on disarmament. We believe that all efforts for disarmament must be pursued in good faith in full compliance with the agreed international regimes.
Based on our principled position, Nepal hosts Regional Center for Peace and Disarmament for Asia and the Pacific. We invite Member States and partners to support and fully utilize the Centre to promote dialogue on disarmament, enhancing the Kathmandu process.

Mr. President,
UN peace operations are an important innovation of the United Nations dedicated to the service of humanity.
Nepal’s engagement in the peace keeping operations immediately after three years of our joining the United Nations speaks volumes of our unflinching commitment to the cause of international peace and security. We feel proud to be part of this flagship contribution.
Our troops have served in various challenging peacekeeping missions with high degree of professionalism, commitment and devotion. This has helped them earn international acclaim. Seventy-three of our fellow countrymen have sacrificed their lives in line of duty to the supreme cause of peace.
We remain steadfast in our commitment to fulfill our obligations and are prepared to provide additional troops and civilians to the UN peace-keeping operations.
This is because we have a strong conviction that the success of the United Nations largely hinges on the success of the peace operations.
However, we also believe that for the peace missions to be successful, there must be unity of purpose in mobilizing entire political capital of the Security Council; clearly defined mandates and operational modalities; adequate resource back-up; safety and security of the personnel; regular consultation and greater collaboration with the troop contributing countries; and a clear exit strategy.
We also believe that peace-keeping alone cannot guarantee durable peace in societies. It should be complemented by proper and clearly defined peace building strategies led and owned by the people and societies themselves.
We would also like to underline that all troop contributing  countries must get fair opportunities to serve in leadership positions both in the field and at the headquarters commensurate with their level and length of contribution.

Mr. President,
It’s a matter of satisfaction that human rights values and norms have now become truly global.
Human rights must not be used as tools to serve hidden political objectives. All human rights, including the right to development, must receive equal priority and be pursued even-handedly.
The salient features of non-selectivity, universality, indivisibility and objectivity must be upheld in all circumstances.
The sanctity of the Human Rights Council and the innovative mechanism of UPR must be maintained to ensure full ownership of human rights on equal footing.
Nepal’s commitment to human rights and fundamental freedom is total and unwavering.
We are party to most of the core international human rights instruments, which have found eloquent expression in Nepal’s newly promulgated constitution.

Mr. President,
The new constitution of Nepal, which was the result of eight years of deliberation to ensure participatory, transparent and inclusive processes, contains impressive list of human rights and constitute adequate remedial measures.
Nepal has abolished death penalty and is a party to the first optional protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
Nepal has put in place necessary legal, institutional and administrative measures for the realization of all human rights.
National Human Rights Commission and other independent constitutional bodies have been established with the sole objective of protecting and promoting human rights in all spheres of national life.
Nepal’s home-grown peace process recognizes transitional justice as its key component.
The Commission on Investigation of Disappeared Persons and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission are carrying out their mandate in an independent and impartial manner. The Government is committed to take appropriate measures to address issues surrounding transitional justice process in line with our international commitment and the ground realities of establishing sustained peace.

Mr. President,
Nepal has been working closely with the Human Rights Council with all sincerity and commitment.
Informed by our experiences of protecting and promoting of human rights and our sincere desire to contribute to the work of the Council, we are seeking membership of the Human Rights Council for the term beginning 2018.
This is the first time we have filed our candidature. We request for support from all fellow member States to our candidature.

Mr. President,
Migration has become a defining phenomenon of contemporary world. Global movement of people has brought both benefits as well as challenges. Proper management of migration can contribute to the economic growth and development of both receiving and origin countries of migrant workers.
Welfare and protection of rights and wellbeing of the migrant workers must therefore receive priority in the countries they work.
As a source country of over three million migrant workers, Nepal calls for concerted efforts at the national, regional and international levels to ensure that this process creates a fair and win-win situation to all.
Despite not being a party to the 1951 Refugee Convention and its Protocol of 1967, Nepal has long been hosting refugees on humanitarian ground.
International burden sharing has greatly contributed to lessen the burden to the host countries. However, refugees’ right to return to their homeland with safety and dignity must always be upheld in all circumstances.

Mr. President,
Globalization, while created many opportunities, has also accrued uneven benefits among the countries.
The constraints of the countries in special situation particularly the LDCs and LLDCs, are real.
International financial, trading and monetary systems thus must be made responsive to their needs and concerns.
Robust implementation of internationally agreed commitments, including those contained in the Istanbul Program of Action, Vienna Programme of Action, Addis Ababa Action Agenda, and Sendai Framework are critically important to enable these countries to emerge from the state of poverty and underdevelopment.
Delay in the conclusion of Doha round of trade negotiations is a huge setback, denying many development dividends of trade and hampering the implementation of the 2030 Agenda.
On the climate change, Nepal as a Himalayan country is facing challenges from the melting glaciers, flash floods, and outburst of glacial lakes. We believe that the Paris Agreement on Climate Change adopted last year reflects a rare commitment of international community to make a difference. We support its early entry into force.
Nepal also believes that climate justice based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibility should be at the center of its implementation. Special attention must be given to the climate vulnerable countries, particularly mountainous countries, in the provisioning of resources and transfer of technology for capacity building and adaptation.
Our efforts must recognize intrinsic connection between poverty reduction, sustainable development and environmental protection.

Mr. President,
We must acknowledge that UN system has a leading role to play in global governance.
An equal emphasis must be laid on all three pillars of the United Nations: development, peace and security, and human rights.
Reform in the United Nations must reflect the vastly transformed political reality of the 21st century.
Our vision for sustainable peace and just world order cannot be realized without a comprehensive reform in the UN system, including the reform of the Security Council. Nepal strongly believes in more representative, inclusive and accountable UN.

Mr. President,
In recent years, Nepal has undergone political transformation of historic proportions.
The decade long armed conflict was finally converted into peace process with the signing of comprehensive peace accord in 2006.
Commitment to democratic norms and values was the central thrust of the peace process that finally led to the first ever elections to the Constituent Assembly.
Management of arms and integration of combatants was successfully completed as part of the peace process. With the promulgation of the democratic constitution on 20 September last year, the peace process has basically come to an end.
Nepal’s homegrown peace process and its success could be a good example for countries transiting from conflict to peace.
The promulgation of constitution represents a turning point in Nepal’s constitutional and political history.
The constitution aims to institutionalize inclusive and democratic polity, pluralism, the rule of law, representative and accountable government, social and economic justice and universally accepted human rights, among others.
Equality is at the core of the constitution. Equal opportunity and protection is guaranteed to every citizen. Discrimination on any ground is prohibited. The state is obliged to take special measures to protect the most marginalized and under-represented sections of society and look after their wellbeing.
Our constitution is not a rigid document rather it is a living and dynamic document and is capable of addressing any remaining or new issues within its framework. The two amendments that were made within months of its promulgation amply proves this.
Currently, we are engaged in dialogue with concerned political parties in the county to find out an acceptable solution to some of the issues where differences persist.
The constitution guarantees equal participation and incorporates principle of proportional representation of the women, indigenous nationalities, Madheshis, Dalits and other marginalized groups in elected and other organs of the state structure.
Nepal has a strong commitment to gender equality and empowerment of women.
Women are guaranteed minimum one third representation in the federal and provincial parliaments and 40% in the local government.
I am proud to inform this General Assembly that Nepal’s Head of State, Chief Justice and Speaker of the Parliament are all women.

Mr President,
We have entered a crucial phase of constitution implementation in Nepal.
Our ultimate goal is to consolidate peace, stability and bring about prosperity in the country. Inclusive economic growth and development is important to sustain political gains. The constitution provides a framework to pursue these objectives.
Democratic elections at all three tiers of the federal set up will have to be completed within February 2018. This is a huge task. But we are determined to do it.
Accomplishing this would help institutionalize the federal democratic system of governance as promised by the Constitution.
Besides, the task of completing remaining issues of peace process, reconstruction and rebuilding of the earthquake ravaged areas, and attaining inclusive prosperity and development constitute our top priorities.

Mr. President,
As we embark on the effective implementation of the constitution and undertaking of the vital tasks of socio-economic transformation of Nepal, good will, solidarity and support from the international community become all the more important.
We are confident that our friends in the international community stand by us in our efforts to consolidate strong foundation for a peaceful, stable, democratic and prosperous Nepal.
To conclude, Mr. President, United Nations today is confronted with unprecedented challenges, however, unique opportunities also exist and can be seized to transform the world into a peaceful place to live in.
We have the capacity, resources and technology to address the challenges and ensure prosperity and dignity to everyone. But we must muster necessary political will to achieve this.
Let’s make solemn commitment at this assembly that the world of tomorrow will be different from that of today. We don’t want the history of 21st century to be written as a history of conflicts, strife, poverty, hunger and indignation, but a history of prosperity, peace, development and partnership.

I thank you for your attention.

Statement by Right Honourable Vice President at the 17th Summit of Non-Aligned Movement  at  Venezuela on 17 September 2016
Posted onSeptember 18, 2016September 18, 2016 

Statement by Right Honourable Mr. Nanda Bahadur Pun, Vice President and Leader of the Nepali delegation to the 17th Summit of Non-Aligned Movement  Margarita Island, Venezuela, 17 September 2016
 
Mr. Chairman,

I have the honour and privilege to represent Nepal at the 17th Summit meeting of the Non-aligned Movement (NAM) being held in this spectacular Margarita Island.


At the outset, I express my sincere gratitude to the Government and people of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela for the warm welcome, generous hospitality extended and for the excellent arrangements that have been put at our disposal since our arrival.


On behalf of the Government and People of Nepal, let me also join other delegations in congratulating you, Mr. Chairman, on your election as the chair of 17th NAM Summit. We have every confidence in your leadership in steering this meeting to a successful outcome. My appreciation also goes to the Islamic Republic of Iran, outgoing Chair of the movement, for the commendable leadership in the process of strengthening our movement since the 16th NAM Summit.

Mr. Chairman,

As a founding member of the Movement, Nepal has unwavering faith in the fundamental principles and ideals of the Movement. The Constitution of Nepal endorses non-alignment as one of the guiding principles of Nepal’s foreign policy. This manifests our strong commitment to the principles of NAM.


Since its inception in 1961, NAM is at the forefront in struggles against the bloc politics, colonialism, apartheid, racism, occupation and pressures. NAM played crucial role to accelerate the pace of self-determination of peoples under colonial and alien domination; and to consolidate the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of member States. The movement has also provided major thrusts in the areas of disarmament, peace, security, greater economic wellbeing, social justice and environmental sustainability. We are confident that this summit would enable us to take stock of achievements made and reflect upon how we, member States, with shared vision and combined strength should respond to the multifaceted and evolving challenges that we all continue to face.


The aftermath of the cold war was expected bringing thaw in the ideologically divided international political landscape. However, it’s an irony that the members of the NAM themselves became engulfed in the intra-state conflicts, violence, ethnic strife, and religious fanaticism. For the movement to reinvigorate itself and demonstrate its continued relevance will require our internal cohesion and coherence as much as our unity, sustained solidarity and shared commitment.

Mr. Chairman,

Today’s world has put both opportunities and challenges especially before the developing countries. We believe that the environment for the lasting peace and security conducive to people-centric development can only be guaranteed under strengthened multilateralism. This provides us much needed synergy to fight against the menace of global terrorism and various forms of transnational crimes. Slow progress in disarmament has taken toll on the scarce resources direly needed to improve the lives of millions of people. NAM’s principled stand on multilateralism should promote consensus on disarmament and coherence on our collective fight against the challenges confronting the world today.


NAM is a voice for peace, justice and equality and it should advance this cause with more zeal. We are deeply concerned over the deadlock of the peace process in the Middle East. It has been our principled position that the Palestine and Israel should live side by side in peace and security with secure international boarder. Syria is in turmoil now. Disproportionate numbers of innocent people have lost their lives and millions have been displaced; yet the solution appears elusive. This humanitarian catastrophe should be avoided. We urge all the parties concerned in the region to enter into dialogue without delay and allow peace a chance. Any solution to the Syrian conflict must be led and owned by Syrian people.


We believe that UN system has a leading role to play in global governance. NAM draws significantly from the principles and purposes of the UN Charter. Respect for sovereign equality, independence and territorial integrity of States and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries must be upheld by all in all circumstances. Peaceful resolution of disputes and fostering an environment of cooperation are of critical importance for ensuring peace and security. The third pillar of the United Nations is weak. We must accord equal emphasis on development, peace and security, and human rights as they are mutually reinforcing. The United Nations itself is in need of reform in order to reflect the vastly transformed political reality of the present day world. Our vision for peaceful and just world order needs comprehensive reform in the UN system and adherence to the rule of law at national, regional and international level.

Mr. Chairman,

There has been much talk about the new humane and equitable international economic order. In reality, globalization and trade liberalization have accrued uneven benefits among states. A large segment of humanity feels to have been left out. The risks coming together with globalization have made developing countries more vulnerable to the shocks of financial and economic crisis, climate change, food crisis, and energy price volatility. The situation becomes bleaker, as the official development assistance continues to decline, the debt burden spirals, market access for our goods and services face restrictions and the conditionality of the international financial institutions remain static. NAM should position itself for the removal of entrenched and systematic inequalities and should continue to stand for global economic justice and shared prosperity to all.


Trade must contribute to reduce poverty and foster growth. Doha round of trade negotiations has long been stalled. Tendency to evade from the Doha Development Agenda risks negating the development dividend of the multilateral trading system. Multilateral trading and financial systems must not fail to recognize the special and differentiated situation of the LDCs and LLDCs and should aim at supporting those countries come forward.


Flow of trade among the NAM Member States has increased manifold. Countries in the South today are leading financer in many areas, including in technologies. South is in better position than ever before to foster South-South cooperation which should be diversified and strengthened in a meaningful way to incorporate all possible areas of mutual benefits. Genuine North-South and triangular cooperation can contribute for development and democratize decision-making structures of the international financial institutions and World Trade Organization. It can also help implement the declarations, commitments, and plan of actions adopted in the various UN sponsored conferences and their follow up meetings. We urge the developed countries to fulfill their commitments of providing 0.7 percent of the GNP to the developing countries and 0.15 to 0.20 percent of GNP to the LDCs as official development assistance


The United Nations has adopted much awaited Sustainable Development Goals last year. This is a time for international community to translate the motto of the SDG conference ‘leave no one behind’ into reality. The LDCs and LLDCs in particular need assistance to overcome structural challenges, eradicate poverty, and promote rapid, equitable and sustainable development. Together with the SDGs we emphasize on full implementation of the commitments made in the Istanbul Program of Action for LDCs and Vienna Program of Action for LLDCs.

Mr. Chairman, 

The new democratic and inclusive constitution was adopted in Nepal on 20 September last year by the popularly elected Constituent Assembly. People of Nepal had long-cherished aspiration to have a constitution written by their own representatives. Nepal had gone through series of political movements, decade long armed conflict and struggles to realize this aspiration. The rigorous democratic exercises spanning over eight years in an inclusive, transparent and participatory manner culminated into the making of the constitution. This marks a historic political watershed. The Constitution ensures inclusive and democratic polity, pluralism, the rule of law, representative and accountable government, social and economic justice and universally accepted human rights. The constitution guarantees equality, dignity, identity and opportunity for all by ending discrimination and inequalities. Fundamental rights of persons belonging to the mosaic of multi-ethnic, multi-lingual, multi-cultural and geographically diverse country are safeguarded. Gender equality which remains at the core of the constitution has already produced female President, Chief Justice and Speaker of the parliament at a time. The constitution adheres to the principles of inclusion and participation, and ensures social justice to all.


We are now in the process of making arrangements to hold democratic elections at all levels of our political structure. The present Government of Nepal has accorded priority to the implementation of the constitution, completing of the remaining issues of peace process, reconstruction and rebuilding of the earthquake ravaged areas, and attaining inclusive prosperity and development. This would help institutionalize the federal democratic system of governance as promised by the Constitution.

Mr. Chairman,

Nepal is land of Lord Buddha and home to the spectacular Mount Everest, the highest point on earth. The vast fresh water resources sprung from the Himalayas constitute the lifeline of millions of people living in the great Himalayan watershed. Impact of climate change in the form of melting glaciers and its environmental consequences has posed danger in the fragile mountain ecosystem. Like other LDCs, we are bearing the brunt of the climate change while having contributed least to greenhouse gas emissions. NAM should accord high priority to this critical issue. Climate vulnerable LDCs in particular should be ensured with necessary funding for adaption and mitigation as well as for easy access to technical knowhow to minimize the negative impacts of climate change.


Nepal plans to graduate by 2022 from LDC status. This uphill task is constrained by the devastating earthquake that struck Nepal in 2015 twice. Around 9 thousand people lost their lives and hundreds of thousands of houses and historical monuments perished. As we have accelerated the pace of reconstruction; an enhanced, comprehensive and robust international support would be instrumental in our endeavor of rebuilding of earthquake ravaged areas.

Mr. Chairman,

We are happy to see NAM’s evolution as a major inter-governmental forum with a great moral strength. I conclude my statement by stressing on three points: First, peace and harmony among the Member States is a must for the NAM to continuously stay as a coherent force. Second, sense of genuine solidarity and unity within the movement is important for us to thrive. And third, NAM must adapt to the changing ground realities of the world and try to influence the events in favor of the developing countries, particularly the most vulnerable among them. I am confident that this summit would be able to chart out our future course to further the collective interests of the movement.

I thank you.

“Nepal-India Partnership for 21st Century”
September 17, 2016
———————————————
Mr. Chairman,
Excellencies, 
Scholars,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I feel honoured for being felicitated amidst this august gathering by the India Foundation on the occasion of my State Visit to India. This is a rare privilege and I do not have words to express my gratitude.
I am equally thankful to the Foundation for giving me the opportunity to share my thoughts on Nepal-India partnership for 21st century at this gathering of intellectuals and luminaries from different walks of life.
It was back in September 2008, I embarked upon my first visit to India as Prime Minister of Nepal. That was a historic visit, a visit from the first Prime Minister of republican Nepal. The visit provided us with an opportunity to cultivate friendly relations with Indian leaders and to explore the new avenues of cooperation in the context of vastly changed political landscape of Nepal.
The memory of that visit is infused with the affection shown by the friendly people of India; with the assurances of support and cooperation expressed by the leaders of India.
And as I am visiting your country second time as prime minister, exactly after eight years, the affection has got more generous; the assurances have got more genial; enthusiasm is enormous; and hope is high.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
My life has been a journey of struggles. Struggles to dismantle the clutches of feudalism, of autocracy. Struggles to set the democracy free from the shackles of tyranny. Struggle for people and their rights. Struggles against the social discrimination. Struggles against the despotism in all hues.
In my struggles I had always carried two weapons with me. Two most powerful weapons -determination and optimism.
Determination for vibrant present,
Optimism for better future,
Determination for change,
Optimism for development
These resolves have been tested on many occasions. I have witnessed the setbacks; encountered the hurdles; and experienced the obstacles. However, my hope and enthusiasm could not be shaken up. My determination did not die. My optimism did not succumb to cynicism.
I have faced the ebb and flow of politics. However, my quest for change, my determination for progress, couldn’t be drained away.
As we gather here, let me remind us all: it is that very optimism that will help us to sail through the waters of 21st century – waters which are full of challenges as well as opportunities.
Ladies and Gentlemen, Dear Friends
India is our close neighbor. Our two countries, Nepal and India, have an immemorial history of harmonious co-existence. We are connected by geography as well as history, by our religions as well as culture.
Our relations are sanctified by the wisdom of saints and sages. Our bonds are strengthened by connectivity as well as commerce.
Our relations began even before the history began to be recorded; they began in the dawn of human civilization in this part of the world.
Our friendship stands on the bastion of good will – good will emanating from the people of Terai, Pahad, and Himal.
The foundation of relations between our two countries rests on cordiality, goodwill, cooperation and mutual respect for sovereign equality. Peaceful coexistence defines our stable friendship.
As friendly neighbours, our two countries have been aware of each other’s concerns and sensitivities. Nepal has not allowed its land to be used against the sovereign interests of India. We are firm in our resolve to maintain that position. And it is natural that we expect similar assurance from India.
Today, in this 21st century, our age-old relations have emerged as more extensive, and multidimensional. The depth of relations has been enriched and the scope of cooperation has been broadened.
The depth of our relationships cannot be fathomed merely through the formal relations between the two governments. The people-to-people interactions and exchanges are at the core of our relations. The open border between our countries dictates us to share a bond of good friendship forever.
As the world sees new walls and barriers, ours can be an example of free movement of people.
As the world sees new conflicts and animosity, ours can be an example of unique amity.
True, we have seen some intermittent glitches in our relations. But they are mere aberrations.  The transient aberrations have no potency to dilute our friendship.
True, we have seen some misunderstandings on both sides. But they cannot hold our mutual goodwill in hostage.
As the world sees the insular fences that are hostile to dialogues, ours can be an example of open and constant exchanges.
True, we may not agree on all of the issues. But our differences cannot highjack the prospect for collaboration.
And the history implores us to take our relations to newer vistas of opportunities, to newer heights of mutual benefits, to the novel territory that suits the intricacies of 21st century.
Dear Friends,
India is the land blessed by noble saints and sages, learned rishis and munis. It is the land of Gandhi – the apostle of non-violence. It is the land of Swami Vivekananda – the key figure to promote Vedanta as well as inter-faith awareness. It is the land of Tagore –an epitome of art and literature. It is the land that has conceived many other geniuses who inspired the human civilization.
As the largest democracy in the world, India has an important role to play in global affairs to make the world order just and democratic.
This century belongs to Asia. And India has an important role to make the 21stcentury an Asian century. The astounding strides made in the industrial development; the inspiring examples unleashed in the field of invention and innovation; the pioneering progress in IT; the remarkable growth of the economy. All of these are set to put India on the global forefront.
The illustrious journey of India as a major economic powerhouse is an inspiration for me and my country.
The splendid stride of India as a nation of innovators is an encouragement for me and the people of my country.
The impressive march of India as the global hub of IT and digital economy is a stimulus for the young generation of my country.
It is my belief that the development trajectory of India will further succeed under the able leadership of Prime Minister Modiji.
For Nepal, India remains the largest trading partner. However, the problem of bilateral trade deficit looms large. We need to focus our attention to diversify our trade basket and scale up the volume of exports from Nepal.
To increase the flow of goods and augment trade, we need to invest in infrastructures and streamline the procedures.
India has extended generous assistance to finance development endeavors of Nepal. It has helped to diversify our economy, build up the infrastructure, and enhance our industrial base. However, there is much to do to scale up our economic cooperation.
To further intensify the economic cooperation, we must create the stories of success; we must translate our pledges into performance.
Nepal and India are endowed with resources, both natural and human. The 21st century should not be the mere century of potentials and resources – lying untapped and dormant.
The abundance of resources needs to be transformed into the opulence of wealth. That transformation will trigger the development.
Potential needs to be unleashed for prosperity. That unleashing of potential will propel the prosperity.
And that transformation can excel only at the behest of closer partnership and stronger commitment.
Nepal’s hydropower development is an important sector for bilateral partnership. It will benefit the people and industries of both of our countries. It is my belief that Nepal’s hydropower, if developed properly, will not only help transform Nepal’s economy, but at the same time can contribute to ‘Make in India’ initiative launched by Modiji in September 2014.
To accelerate the investment in hydropower projects, we have to implement the Power Trade Agreement, which we had signed back in 2014. We need to ensure unrestricted market access on both sides in order to convince the investors.We may think of going sub-regional to promote energy cooperation, and I see a better prospect within the framework of BBIN.
The people of Nepal stood by India during its struggle for independence. Today, they are standing by the people of India in their quest for development.
India remains one of the most preferred destinations for students from Nepal. The prestigious institutions, high-quality academic ambience and ever evolving innovative rigor of Indian universities and schools have lured students from Nepal. This has facilitated the sharing of ideas, connected the minds and has brightened up the prospect for collaborative future.
Thousands of Nepali nationals are working in the Indian job market. They have contributed to the economic development of India. And the remittances they bring home have equally helped the economy of Nepal.
Similarly, a sizeable Indian workforce is in Nepal. Some are engaged in semi-skilled sectors. Some are employed in skilled sectors. Their contribution is mutually rewarding to both of our countries.
This exchange of workforce is not just the exchange of people. It is the exchange of skills and exchange of experiences.
This flow of remittances is not just the flow of incomes. It is the flow that links our two economies; it is the flow that feeds several thousands of families in both countries.
Nepal is an attractive destination for Indian tourists. Attracted by the natural heritage as well as religious sites, Indian tourists have contributed to Nepal’s economy.
Similarly, India is an attractive destination for Nepali tourists and pilgrims too. The beautiful heritages of this large country and its pious shrines have enticed a large number of Nepalis.
These phenomena of visits, for vacation as well as veneration, have been the vehicles of familiarization with each other’s countries, interaction among the people. The air connectivity, direct bus services and open border have augmented this exchange.
To enhance the flow of people, for enterprise as well as tourism – we need to further expand air connectivity and road linkage.
To infuse our relations with more substance; to imbue our friendship with more harmony; to make our relations mutually rewarding; and to contextualize our relations as per the needs of 21st century;
We need to build on our commonalities,
We need to engage in dialogues to enhance understanding,
We need to synergize our engagements,
And, we need to capitalize on our strengths.

Ladies and Gentlemen,
When the devastating earthquake struck Nepal last year, India acted promptly and spontaneously for the rescue and relief of victims. At the difficult hour of national tragedy, people of India stood by us. That reflected the closeness of our relations.
Allow me, dear friends, from this podium to express once again my thankfulness to the Government and people India for the generous assistance they extended in times of crisis.
Also, allow me to thank the Government of India for its generous pledge for the reconstruction works. This gesture of fraternity is fresh in our memories and will remain so for many years to come.
Dear Friends,
For the last two decades, Nepal has undergone unprecedented political transformation. People’s movements and struggles for democracy succeeded to usher the nation into the new era of democracy and inclusiveness, new era of federalism and decentralization.
A decade-long armed conflict came to an end, when we signed the Comprehensive Peace Accord in 2006. Yearning to charter their own constitution, Nepali people elected their representatives and formed the Constituent Assembly.
This gave way for the end of feudal era and the establishment of the republican government, where the sovereignty rests with people, where human rights and fundamental freedoms are guaranteed to all Nepalis without any discrimination.
In all these epoch-making events – from the people’s war and people’s movement to the promulgation of the constitution – my own party, CPN Maoist Centre, was on the forefront. Support and solidarity received from the international community including India in our homegrown political transformation and peace process were definitely of great importance.
Our quest for democratic polity, inclusive governance and federalism was materialized last year when the second Constituent Assembly promulgated the Constitution of Nepal. The new constitution has embraced the system of inclusive democracy, federalism, rule of law, and respect for human rights as per the aspirations of diverse communities in the country.
Within the last two decades, many epoch-making changes have occurred; significant political achievements have been made. And the responsibility lies on our leadership to institutionalize these changes through the effective implementation of the constitution.
Therefore, the present Government has prioritized the implementation of the constitution by bringing all segments of Nepali society on board.
I would like to mention that the dialogue with Terai-Madhes-based political parties has already started. I believe that this dialogue will soon bring about tangible result.
Concluding the remaining task of the peace process is equally important priority for the present Government. The Government is committed to concluding the remaining tasks, including the transitional justice, as envisaged in the Peace Accord and according to the spirit of the peace process.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Political transformation remains fragile in the absence of socio-economic transformation. Creation of inclusive and right-based society remains elusive without economic development. Peace cannot prosper if society starves in poverty.
Aware of this reality, socio-economic transformation is high on our agenda.
The world in this century is interconnected like never before. The scale of globalization is unprecedented. The scale of interdependence is extraordinary.
In this globalized and interconnected century, individual efforts alone will not be sufficient to achieve the objective of development. It demands collaboration and cooperation at bilateral, sub-regional, regional and multilateral levels.
Nepal and India share the collaborative platforms in various regional and sub-regional forums. Our countries have vital role in the SAARC and BIMSTEC. In the pursuits of regional development, we have engaged closely in these forums. BBIN initiative provides yet another important platform for sub-regional collaboration.
The tremendous growth performance of our two neighbours comes with plethora of opportunities for growth and development. And, as both of these economic giants are engaging in large volume of trade and investment, those opportunities are getting more pronounced. We need to capitalize on unfolding opportunities to forge a productive partnership for development.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Yesterday, I had a very friendly and fruitful meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modiji. We covered a wide range of areas of mutual interest in our discussions. Our deliberations were substantive and positive.
We are ready to inject new dynamisms into our relations, without letting the misunderstandings of the past to derail our friendship.
To embark upon the path of closer partnership, we should buttress trust and enhance understanding.
To inoculate understanding of higher order, we should not be dragged down by the unpleasant experiences.
The enablers for cordial friendship, collaborative partnership and mutually rewarding relations are there. We must build on those enablers to boost our relations. We must seize the opportunities to make our relations fruitful to the lives of our peoples. As close neighbours, we share a common destiny which demands collective pursuit of prosperity.
I firmly believe, and hope you all would agree, a peaceful, stable, prosperous and democratic Nepal is in the interest of India as well as that of our larger neibourhood. This reality must inform our thoughts and actions in forging a partnership for 21st century. A partnership that befits our intimacy and shared destiny.
Finally, let me conclude by reiterating my hope for closer and mutually rewarding relations between our two countries in this 21st century.
 I thank you once again for such a wonderful opportunity.
I thank you all for your kind attention.

Keynote Address by The Rt. Hon’ble Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’, Prime Minister of Nepal, at the Interaction Programme with the Business Community in New Delhi, September 16, 2016
Mr. Chairperson,
Hon. Ministers,
Presidents and office bearers of Chambers of Commerce and Industries from India and Nepal,
Senior officials from the Government of India,
Members in my delegation,
Ladies and Gentlemen:
Thank you for providing me this opportunity to interact with the leaders of Indian business and industry.
I have brought with me the captains of Nepali businesses and industry as part of my delegation.
Our message is clear that in an age of globalization, we can find better future only if Government and Private sector march together.
I hope our business delegation will fully utilize the valuable time by engaging with their Indian counterparts in explaining business and investment linkages between the two countries.
Dear friends,
Many of you are aware of Nepal’s political transformation. My Party led the ten year long armed struggle from 1996 to 2006. It was a struggle against poverty, backwardness and injustice deeply entrenched in our society for centuries. Thousands of people sacrificed their lives dreaming for a ‘New Nepal’ – a developed and prosperous place where justice would prevail. Dream of New Nepal had two facets – political justice and economic betterment.
After entering into the peace process, we spent the last ten years in the process of political transformation – from armed struggle to peaceful, democratic and inclusive political process. With the promulgation of the Constitution last year, we have been able to lay the foundation of justice-based polity. We are aware of the demands for further improvement in sharing socio-economic benefits. My Government is committed to accommodate the demands in the best possible manner.
While political process has started to take a course, economic agenda of ‘New Nepal’ is yet to take a concrete shape. After political settlement, the economic prosperity is our sole agenda, for which foreign investment is vital. As politics is getting stabilized, law and order situation has been significantly improved. Nepal is therefore, being a safer destination for foreign investment.
When it comes to growth and development, India, under Prime Minister Modiji’s leadership is setting a great example. Being on the top among major economies in receiving FDI, you are the favourite destination for foreign investors and Indian investors have their investment in many countries around the world.
My message to the business leaders in India – if far flung corners of the world can be your destinations, why cannot the next door Nepal? Nepal, though a small country, can be an attractive business avenue, by which you have the market of 2.5 billion populations in its two neighboring countries.
Tell us precisely what we need to do for you and your investment there. We are ready to listen and reform.  Let’s make a common pledge: You commit to make Nepal your next home for business. We commit to create the best possible business environment for you.
Dear business leaders,
In terms of policy orientation, Nepal is pursuing a liberal economic policy. Government is only a facilitator and we see multiple role of private sector as key actors, as innovators, as entrepreneurs and as leaders in the domain of economic growth and development.
Over the years, we have taken steps to promote trade, investment and the growth of private sector. In our pursuit of growth and development, we have reduced tariffs, simplified tax regimes and focused on the development and operation of trade related infrastructure. You will find Nepal much ahead of many countries in offering attractive incentives for investment. Yet we believe more can be done to reform the investment regime. We are continuously working on this.
Our Parliament has recently endorsed the SEZ Bill. This provides strong incentives for industries including liberal labour law. We plan to establish SEZs in major industrial centers of the country, most of which will be in the plain land next to Nepal-India border.
We have made administrative procedures simple and Doing Business environment is gradually improving. Investment Board of Nepal, whose CEO is with us today, provides big investors all kinds of advices related to investment in Nepal as well as one door services and facilitation.
We have favorable fiscal environment. Our tax slabs are low. There is no income tax on dividends and export earnings. We exempt tax, duty and fee on the key inputs used by an export industry. In this pursuit, similar simplified tax arrangements by India may support trade and investment for mutual benefits.
We permit full repatriation of income earned from investment. The same rule is applicable to reinvestment. Foreign companies registered in Nepal can purchase, own and sell land. We provide various sector-specific incentives of various kinds and scope.
There is no discrimination between Nepali and Indian investors. Our law guarantees that no private industry will be nationalized. We are in process of ratifying BIPPA signed with India. Double taxation avoidance agreement has also been signed.
Public private partnership is sought and promoted, including in large scale infrastructure projects.
We have abundant labour force, which is cheaper and reliable. Latest census shows that the working age population has increased to 57 percent, which is high even from developing country standard. We have improved industrial relations including through reform in labour law.
Dear friends,
The pattern of trade and investment in the 21st century is shifting. Economies are integrating and production process is disintegrating. Value chains are on the rise, strengthening of which would be beneficial to both our countries.
As infrastructure remains at the core of economic development, we have given top priority to cross-border connectivity. Our cross border infrastructures are improving. Railway connectivity is being established at 5 different points and modern integrated check posts at 4 places.
Both of our countries are working in concert to improve cross border roads. Bilateral Motor Vehicle Agreement has been signed and operationalized between the two countries to make movement easy.
We have opened up almost every sector for foreign investment. These include manufacturing, hydropower, tourism, services, IT, mining and agro based industries.
Hydropower offers us vast potential for development. Proper utilization of Nepal’s hydropower resources could help transform our economic landscape. Our two countries can seriously work together to convert huge water resources into wealth.
We have already reached two big hydropower deals with Indian companies. We have signed Power Trade Agreement with India. We are encouraged that Government of India is reviewing its policy and regulation to implement the free market provisions of the PTA.
Transmission infrastructure is being strengthened. First double circuit cross border transmission line is now operational and second cross-border transmission line is being developed.
Tourism is another lucrative sector for investors. We are gifted with beauty of nature and treasures of culture and civilization, in which we are closely linked with India.
We are receiving a larger number of tourists from India every year – as pilgrims, vacationers and business delegations. It’s an opportunity to invest in facilities to cater to this growing number.
Development of supporting infrastructure is essential to drive tourism industry. We are developing regional international airports at two prime touristic hubs of Pokhara and Lumbini, and more are in the pipeline. Investing in tourism sector will definitely be a wise decision.
Agriculture and herbal processing is another area where we invite your investment. This is viable because of varied altitude and topography available in Nepal.
I am confident that today’s interaction will help infuse much needed confidence among the prospective investors to move forward with concrete business and investment proposals in Nepal.
Before I conclude, I would like to share with you that I have had productive discussions with Prime Minister Modiji and other senior ministers in his cabinet about expanding and consolidating economic and commercial ties between our two countries. We also discussed promoting bilateral cooperation for the development and expansion of cross border connectivity in all forms. I am encouraged by positive response received from the Indian side. All we have to do is to capitalize this opportunity.
I thank you for your patience and once again for this opportunity.
Thank you.

Remarks by The Rt. Hon.PM of Nepal, at the joint media briefing with H.E. Shri Narendra Modi, PM of India, New Delhi, September 16, 2016
Posted onSeptember 16, 2016September 16, 2016 

Remarks by The Rt. Hon’ble Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’, Prime Minister of Nepal, at the joint media briefing with His Excellency Shri Narendra Modi, Prime Minister of India, New Delhi, September 16, 2016
Your Excellency Prime Minister Modiji
 Excellencies
 Distinguished media persons,
I thank Prime Minister Modiji for his kind words.Your words and sentiments mean a lot for me and my country. We have nothing but goodwill to exchange in keeping with excellent tradition of our friendly relations. I have been overwhelmed by the warm welcome and generous hospitality of the Government and friendly people of India. I must mention how privileged and honoured I have been to stay at the prestigious Rashtrapati Bhawan as State Guest of the Government of India. I have taken this as a natural reflection of our intimate and extensive relationship.
I have stated time and again that Government under my leadership is deeply committed to strengthening relations with neighbours. It is in this vein I sent special envoy to India in less than two weeks after the formation of the Government. In less than a month of assuming office, I have embarked on a State Visit to India. This is my second visit as Prime Minister, but the context and circumstances of the two visits are vastly different.
This morning immediately after the ceremonial reception at the forecourt of Rashtrapati Bhawan, I visited Rajghat to pay tribute to Mahatma Gandhi, the apostle of non-violence and pioneer of liberation movement. That was a tribute to Gandhiji’s greatness. He has left for us and for generations to come an enduring lesson of humility, discipline and public welfare.
Prime Minister Modiji and I have just concluded extensive discussion on the entire gamut of our relationship. We did that in an atmosphere of trust and understanding. We shared the view that given our deep and extensive relationship, a meaningful partnership between our two countries is crucialto unlock huge potentials that we have for our mutual benefits. I am convinced that without economic prosperity, political transformation cannot be sustainable. This fact has become all the more important for my country, which has emerged from conflict and just accomplished a task of political transformation of historic proportion. We realize that a peaceful, stable, democratic and prosperous Nepal contributes to peace and stability in the neighbourhood and beyond.
We exchanged substantive views on taking concrete steps to elevate our relations to a new height in all spheres — political, economic, social and cultural. We expressed our firm determination to forge an enduring partnership for development and prosperity and in this context had useful exchanges on the various projects and programmes that have the potential to bring about tangible results to our people.
We exchanged views on our respective ‘neighbourhood first’ policies and agreed that this common orientation in our policies should lead to a greater and mutually beneficial partnership for 21st century based on trust and open dialogue.
I expressed view that trust and confidence are the pre-requisites of strong and sustainable friendly relations. And to ensure this, we should respect each other’s sensitivities and concerns in a spirit of good neighbourliness.
We discussed that Nepal and India are friends and bound to remain friends. Our friendship and fraternity stand on the solid foundation of the historical ties of shared culture and civilizational linkage on the other hand and the time-honoured principles of Panchasheel and the UN Charter on the other.We need to carry forth this relation in the changed context of 21st century which warrants a new perspective as well as frank and open dialogues on our interests and concerns.
As close neighbours, our destinies are interlinked. I shared with Prime Minister Modiji how inspired we are by India’s growth and prosperity under his strong and bold leadership. We talked happily about the tremendous progress India has made in economic transformation, science, technology, communication, research and innovation. I stated with Modiji that Nepal is eager to learn from India’s success story and forge an enduring partnership for shared economic development.
In our discussion, we were extensively focused on agenda of development, growth, trade and connectivity. I emphasized on the need to effectively implement the projects we agreed on in time bound manner.
India has provided us generous development cooperation. These resources have been used in vital infrastructure projects, health, education and rural development. We stressed on the need of time bound completion of the ongoing projects by addressing hindrances on respective sides. We talked about joint monitoring of the ongoing projects. Key among the ongoing projects are 4 Integrated Check Posts, 5 Cross Border railwaysand Postal roads phase I.
Cooperation in Energy sector was our focus. Both of us appreciated that signing of Power Trade Agreement two years ago was an important achievement in fostering Nepal India partnership in energy sector. We agreed on the need of early operationalization of the free market provision by reviewing law and regulation.
We agreed on the need of early finalizing the DPR of Pancheshwar Multipurpose Project.
Considering the hydropower projects in pipeline in Nepal, we discussed about starting work for the development of the second cross border transmission line connecting Butwal. Nepal is currently facing power crisis and the need of importing power may continue for a short term. We discussed about how India can help us in meeting the short term power needs in the best possible way.
India’s cooperation in our infrastructure development has remained significant. I thankedModiji for providing three concessional Lines of Credits so far. We talked about expediting implementation of projects identified under the third LoC. One of the projects is motorable bridge at Mahakaliriver. Once realized, the bridge will turn out to be a vital linkage between the two countries. We also talked about fresh Line of Credit to fund for the development of Postal road phase II and sub stations for hydropower.
Trade, transit and connectivity were our important agenda.I shared with Prime Minister Modiji Nepal’s concern over growing trade deficit. Currently our import from India is over 10 times higher than export. We agreed on the need to take measures to address such imbalance, which cannot be sustainable in long term. Nepal expects support from India’s public and private sector in industrialization and growth of trade.
We discussed about Nepal’s request for additional three air entry routes. We have instructed our civil aviation authorities to finalize the matter in the next meeting.
Prime Minister Modiji and I noted with satisfaction that Eminent Group of Persons have started to work. They have been given a broad mandate to assess the overall context of Nepal-India bilateral relations and recommend measures to be taken for better relations including the way to address outstanding issues.
Both of us discussed that control of cross border crimes and maintaining sanctity of our border and No Man’s Land are mutual security interests of the two countries in which greater cooperation and understanding need to be ensured.
India is rising in its global stature and it has a visible mark in global arena as the largest successful world democracy. I assured Prime Minister Modiji that Nepal fully supports India’s aspiration for greater roles in international institutions.
Last but not least, I also shared with Prime Minister Modiji that the promulgation of the Constitution last year by the popularly elected Constituent Assembly was a historic achievement for the people of Nepal. You are aware that my Government has made serious efforts to bring everyone on board as we enter the phase the implementation of the Constitution in the interest of all segments of Nepali society.
Both of us agreed that exchanges of visit at the highest political level should be regular between the two countries. The Rt. Hon President of Nepal has invited His Excellency the President of India to visit Nepal this year. And I have invited Prime Minister Modiji to visit Nepal.  We eagerly look forward to welcoming both President Pranabji and Prime Minister Modiji to Nepal in near future.
Thank you.

Statement by Hon. DPM and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Kamal Thapa at the plenary session of the midterm review of the IPOA being held in Antalya, Turkey.
Posted onMay 27, 2016May 27, 2016 

Mr. Chairman,
It is my honour to be here in this beautiful city of Antalya for the comprehensive midterm review of the implementation of the Istanbul Programme of Action for LDCs for the decade 2011-2020. I would like to express my deep appreciation to the Government and people of the Republic of Turkey for so generously hosting this important event and for providing us with the excellent hospitality, back to back with the first ever World Humanitarian Summit. Allow me also to put on record our sincere appreciation to the Government of Turkey for their continued interest in, and support for, the cause of the LDCs.
I thank the United Nations Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, as well as the Secretary-General of the Conference, USG Mr. Gyan Chandra Acharya and his team for the preparation of the midterm review. I also wish to take this opportunity to thank the PRs of Belgium and Benin for their expert guidance as co-facilitators during the inter-governmental negotiations in the run up to this conference. I commend the role of Bangladesh as Chair of the global coordinating bureau of the LDCs throughout the process.
Mr. Chairman,
Five years ago, in Istanbul, we agreed to the ambitious goal of enabling half of the LDCs to meet the criteria for graduation by 2020. I recall with pleasure that Nepal had the honour to steer the negotiations on IPOA as Chair of the global coordination bureau of LDCs. For this purpose, we also set priorities and articulated specific goals and targets, along with the actions to be undertaken by the LDCs and their development partners. Yet, the full implementation of the IPOA still remains a challenge.
Nepal stresses the need of effective, full and timely implementation of the IPOA in coherence and synergies with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and other landmark achievements made last year. For this, the national efforts need to be complemented by adequate international support measures in all pillars including ODA, investments, trade and technology transfer. Addressing structural problems, building productive capacities, and enhancing trade and investment continue to be in our agenda.
More importantly, the IPOA implementation should help overcome the shortcomings due to which only four LDCs could graduate since 1971, when the group was created. It should also serve as the guide to our collaboration with development partners, and to forging solidarity in the international forums. In this context, the importance of the mid-term review of the IPOA cannot be overemphasized.
During the review exercise, we have reflected on the progress made, together with the best practices, and agreed for a way forward for the remaining period to fully implement the IPOA. Since the second half of the IPOA implementation period coincides with the first five years of the 2030 Agenda, it is important to gear up all national, regional and international efforts in tandem.
Mr. Chairman,
In all our efforts, poverty comes on the way as the main hurdle. For example, the abject and widespread poverty in the LDCs makes every day look like a day in the disaster for many people in those countries. Poverty and exclusion foster the breeding ground for conflicts. Together, the increasingly adverse effects of climate change and frequent natural disasters give rise to frequent humanitarian crises in our countries. These often take away the lives and livelihood of our people, reverse our development gains and diminish the economic prospects. Building long-term resilience to disasters must therefore receive priority in line with the recently agreed relevant instruments.
Poverty in LDCs also restricts their technological advancement – a direct enabler of development. While the existing and emerging crises and challenges pose serious threats to their socio-economic progress, the lack of technology base tends to keep them marginalized from the new opportunities. It is in this context that we need to ensure that the Technology Bank operates and evolves as a mechanism for necessary support for the LDCs.
Mr. Chairman,
Nepal was making all efforts to implement the IPOA and we were on a right track on making good progress. We have integrated the IPOA into our development programs as well as periodic plans. Soon after the IPOA was adopted, Nepal set a goal for itself to graduate by 2022.
Nepal even met the two of the three criteria for graduation for the first time the other year.
Unfortunately, the earthquakes of April and May last year, the obstruction in supplies for several months at the southern border points affected the entire economy, resulting into a humanitarian crisis in the country. Against this backdrop, our goal of smooth and sustainable graduation has become all the more challenging.
The cost of recovery from the earthquakes alone has been estimated at 8.38 billion US dollars. The reconstruction works that aim at ‘building back better’ will require more resources, time and strong partnership. We have started the reconstruction in earnest and are confident that, with enhanced and sustained international support, we will build back better and smarter. To this end, the Government has already adopted a post-disaster recover framework.
I wish to inform this meeting that, with the promulgation of a rights-based, progressive and inclusive constitution in September 2015, soon after the earthquakes, Nepal has entered into a new era of hope and confidence for national development. The development agenda has now come to the fore with the logical conclusion of the peace process and protracted political transition in the country.
We are now in the process of finalizing a new periodic plan for the country, incorporating the 2030 Agenda. We share the common vision of the world as set out in the 2030 Agenda and other important instruments. We have already begun to integrate them into our development plans and processes. Obviously, the need for constant support for the cause of the LDCs was never greater. The means of implementation, including the resources, technology and partnership to be further enhanced in view of the broader recognition of our challenges as well as potentials. While we remain committed to mobilizing the domestic resources to the extent possible, the narrow resources base and limited economic activities compel us to seek a meaningful global partnership to mobilize required resources for development financing.
Mr. Chairman, I wish to conclude by stressing, once again, the importance of the full implementation of IPOA for the LDCs, and expressing the confidence that, through the Outcome of this review conference, which I understand is a comprehensive and forward-looking document, the momentum generated five years ago in Istanbul will be maintained and that the IPOA will be implemented with commensurate resources, technology and partnerships, for the benefit of nearly 900 million people in the LDCs.
Thank you very much.

Posted onMay 24, 2016May 24, 2016 

Fellow co-chairs,
Moderators,
I wish to thank the Secretary-General for convening the Summit and outlining the objectives and modalities of this round table.  Thank you also Mr. Secretary-General for this honour given to Nepal.
I deal on the theme representing one of themountain countries of the world that is most vulnerable to climate change and disasters. I also share the lessons that we have learned following the devastating Nepal earthquakes last year.
In Nepal, increased adverse impacts of climate changeon environment, weather patterns, water availability, physical infrastructure, agriculture, forestry, bio-diversity and socio-economic activities, among others, have led to serious humanitarian consequences. This has dragged the lives and livelihoods of millions of people into more difficulty every year.
Floods, landslides, earthquakes and fire hazards are major incidences of disasters that periodically hit one orthe other part of our country. The mutually exacerbating impacts of climate change and disasters make the situation more complicated.
Drawing lessons from our experiences, I can share with you the following points on dealing with climate change and disasters:

Putting in place effective policy, strategy, legal and institutional mechanism is a very important step towards ensuring a consistent framework for climate action andmultistakeholder partnership at the national, regional and international levels. In Nepal, we have a National Adaptation Plan of Action, a Local Adaptation Plan of Action, environmental and climate policies and programmes as well as Environment and Climate Change Councils at the highest level to muster political will in this area.
Mobilization of local community in adaptation and mitigation measures can bear meaningful results. But for more innovative problem-solving and resilience building, an easy access to affordable technology is necessary. Attention should be paid to more public financing for adaptation activities, and leveraging public and private partnerships for mitigation measures.
Improvement of livelihood opportunities of poor farmers through careful utilization of ecosystem services.
Development and promotion of alternative and sustainable energy sources.
Fostering green growth strategies based on locally available resources.
The Himalayan region lacks science-based knowledge and data that can be applied to mitigate climate change and disasters, develop an early warning system and disaster preparedness,promote innovation, and build resilience. We therefore need support to establish a Climate Research Centre in our country. We believe that this would prove useful for over a billion people living in the upstream as well as downstream areas,and in consolidating the sustainability of ecosystem services.
We emphasize the implementation of the Kathmandu Call for Action, 2012 for healthy ecosystem and people-centric development in the larger framework of
No society or nationkeeps capability to tackle mega disastersalone. Dealing with big disasters call for institutional capacity-buildingfor resilience not only at the local and national levels, but also at regional and international levels. We await the creation of a sound architecture for global synergy of efforts backed up by identified institutional mechanisms.
Build back better for increased resilience at the community level to ensure quick response and avoidance of bigger losses of life and property when disasters strike.
Build back better calls for increased financial resources, application of technology suitable to the local situation, and increased innovation.
More smart and coordinated support for rescue, rehabilitation and recovery efforts is called for. Massive emotional outpouring and subsequent voluntary contributions of individual and institutional donors across the globe come in the name of the disaster victims, but mechanisms are lacking for ensuring transparency and accountability in the transfer of such funds to the disaster hit countries and people.
We emphasize that money raised through donations be delivered through the national government system to make holistic impacts. This will ensure equity and justice in distribution, while also avoiding skewed choice and unnecessary fragmentation of efforts.
Rescue and rehabilitation supports alone are not enough in disaster-hit areas suffering from massive poverty. Continuous supports are necessary until the reconstruction and rebuilding tasks are accomplished along the principles established by Sendai framework for DRR.
Humanitarian assistance should be guided by total dedication, not by petty interest or profit motive.

In the face of massive disaster, we experienced that we were not alone. We saw first hand how a collective resolve to work in solidarity, with pools of resources and capacities is the best way to face such challenges which cannot be tackled alone. I believe this is where lies the importance of core commitments that we are asked to pledge at this Summit. Nepal would be very happy if my thoughts would be useful to Member countries.

Statement by Hon’ ble Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs Mr. Kamal Thapa at the World Humanitarian Summit (23 May 2016, Istanbul)
Posted onMay 24, 2016 

Mr. Chairperson,
I Wish to thank the Secretary-General for convening the first ever World Humanitarian Summit, and for articulating the humanitarian agenda drawing the attention of the international community to the five core responsibilities and relevant actions.
The agenda for humanity requires common understanding, strategic approach and strengthened global partnership and collaboration. The Government of Turkey deserves our appreciation for generously hosting this important Summit.
For countries with limited means and capacity, managmg all potential risks and vulnerabilities IS a formidable challenge.
In 2015, Nepal confronted natural disasters exacerbated by severe obstruction of supplies. We are yet to recover from their profound humanitarian consequences. The devastation caused by the earthquakes has undermined the development gains made by us so far. We are also confronted with a massive need of restoring our archeological and cultural heritage, which are among the listed world heritage sites.
Despite these adversities, our unity and resilience has guided us to a common hope for the future.
We have established an autonomous National Reconstruction Authority, and have adopted a comprehensive Post-Disaster Recovery Framework to advance post-disaster reconstruction work. We look forward to receiving substantive contributions to implement this framework.
Having learned from our long-drawn experience of struggle for democracy, a decadelong armed conflict and nine years of transition to peace, we cannot agree more with the humanitarian agenda of the Secretary-General. Our peace process concluded last September by adopting an ambitious and inclusive rights-based as well as forwardlooking constitution written by an elected Constituent Assembly.
We are confident that the implementation of this ambitious constitution will help us build a peaceful and harmonious society free from conflicts, and enhance our capacity to respond to potential crises in the future. We appeal to the international community to appreciate the hard-earned achievements, and support us to implement the constitution with enhanced and meaningful partnership.
The foundation of lasting peace can only be built by addressing the root causes of conflicts, which are often engendered by social and economic disparities and inequalities.
As poverty and deprivation remain breeding grounds for all kinds of conflicts, elimination of poverty must get topmost priority.
The adverse effects of climate change and the increased severity and magnitude of disasters call for outcome-oriented actions along the established principles of common but differentiated responsibilities. Harmonization and coordination of national, regional and global strategies will make a huge difference in dealing with these menaces.
The Sendai framework for Disaster Risk Reduction lays emphasis on building back better through preparedness, innovation and resilience-building. It requires effective implementation keeping people at the centrestage. Similarly, all member countries are obliged to fulfil the commitments pertaining to the Paris Climate Agreement, based on respective responsibilities.
I believe that local communities must be empowered, strengthened and institutionalized in the management of disasters and resilience-building through a system of fair and adequate distribution of resources, capacity-building and technology transfer for additional innovation and local solutions. That is why we have given first priority to the holding of local elections in our country towards the end of this year.
Mr. Chairperson,
The rights of the migrant workers must be looked at with full respect, with emphasis on orderly and humane aspect of migration, and in appreciation of their contribution to development and cross-fertilization of human civilization historically.
Development finance remains a lifeline for LDC development. Development and humanitarian cooperation should go hand-in-hand. But humanitarian assistance should not come at the cost of development financing. We strongly call for a predictable and equitable means and new ways of securing humanitarian funding. The humanitarian principles of neutrality, independence, impartiality and universality should be upheld and adhered to in all circumstances.
I believe in the need to find solutions to humanitarian crises by respecting the sensitivity of local culture, the ownership and leadership of the development agenda and, more importantly, the independence, territorial integrity and sovereignty of the nations as enshrined in the UN Charter.
Thank you !

Posted onMay 11, 2016May 11, 2016 

Briefing to Diplomatic Community in Kathmandu by Hon’ble Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Kamal Thapa, May 11, 2016
Right Honourable Prime Minister,
Honourable Ministers,
Excellencies,
Friends from Media,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Thank you for your presence here.
One year has passed since the devastating earthquakes hit our country causing huge loss of life and property and heavy setback to economy. Two weeks back, we marked the first anniversary of the tragic event. It has also been over 6 months since the promulgation of the Constitution.
During this period we have witnessed many new developments on political, social and economic fronts. This briefing today is meant for sharing our observations and thoughts on some of these developments.
We are grateful to the Right Hon’ble Prime Minister for his gracious presence on this occasion.
It took us some time to extend due focus on post-earthquake reconstruction. Building legal and institutional set-up took a while. And in the meantime, we had to face an uneasy situation at Nepal-India border points with interruption of supplies.
A little late though, now we have intensified reconstruction works with sincere commitment and determination. You may recall that the Right Honourable President and the Right Honourable Prime Minister had begun the mega reconstruction initiative a few months back, coinciding the date of the biggest ever earthquake in Nepal’s history in 1834. Now, I am happy to share that all necessary legal and institutional frameworks for the reconstruction have been established. Priorities have been determined; action-plan has been finalized; and, implementation has been already initiated.
Our valued development partners made generous pledge during last year’s International Conference on Nepal’s Reconstruction. We have already concluded framework agreements with most of our partners specifying the modality of utilization and allocation of the fund. Specific list of projects have been communicated to some of you and to others we will do so very soon.
National Reconstruction Authority has made a positive decision on and approved guidelines for the involvement of non-government organizations in reconstruction campaign. NGOs can undertake reconstruction projects after signing tripartite agreement with NRA and local stakeholders. Since Chief Executive Officer of the Reconstruction Authority will share with you in details about the progress made so far and the plan ahead tomorrow in a separate programme, I do not want to go into details.
Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
While visiting different countries, I have felt that there is still misperception and misunderstanding about our Constitution. There is a perception that the constitution is not complete, inclusive and broad-based. The fact of the matter is that critics have either not studied the Constitution fully or they do not want to assess its content fairly and objectively.
We have not claimed that our Constitution is hundred percent perfect. Nowhere in the world such perfection is possible. But to judge by any fair standard, it encompasses the main features of a democratic and inclusive polity. The Constitution guarantees human rights and fundamental freedoms to all citizens without any discrimination. State policies are aimed at uplifting the overall status of all section of society.
Concrete measures have been devised to promote inclusive representation in all levels of governance.
In terms of process, it was broad-based, consultative and participative. In terms of content, it is comprehensive, inclusive and substantive. And, in terms of orientation, it is forward-looking, progressive and dynamic.
Then, how can we still say that this constitution is not inclusive and broad-based?
We can also make an honest comparison with other constitutions developed under similar circumstances to demonstrate that this constitution is truly inclusive, forward-looking and progressive.
The Government of Nepal has made it clear that based on experience gained through its implementation, improvement can be made in the Constitution. The fact that we made the First Amendment of the Constitution within 4 months of its promulgation reflects how flexible and accommodative document it is. The Government is ready to resolve all issues through dialogue.
The Government has constituted a high level political committee, which I am heading myself, with a view to finding an acceptable solution to the remaining issue of demarcation. The Government is committed to give full shape to the Committee and deliberate for addressing genuine concerns of the agitating parties within the framework provided by the Constitution. You may be aware that just earlier this week the Government officially communicated to the agitating parties invited them for talk.
The Government’s focus is now on implementation of the Constitution. In this process, we have already amended 193 laws incompatible with the Constitution. Additional 138 laws will be enacted within a year and this will provide legal foundation for the full implementation of the Constitution.
For the implementation of federalism and administrative restructuring, a High Level Steering Committee at political level and a Coordination Committee at administrative level have been constituted. For the restructuring of the local level, the Commission constituted to determine the number and boundary of Village Bodies, Municipalities and Special, Protected or Autonomous Areas has been working.
Local bodies have remained without elected representative for the past 14 years. It may still take some time to determine number and boundary and legal basis of local level as per federal structure. So, the Government has decided to hold the election for the existing local bodies within November/December 2016 as provided in the new constitution. This will help ensure democratic exercise at people’s level, rule of law and leadership of people’s representatives in local development and end the condition of absence of people’s representatives at local bodies.
The Annual Policy and Programme of the Government revealed just the other day states that the Government will work with a motto: ‘Implementation of Constitution: Socio-economic Progress of Nepal and Nepalis’.
Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Nepal’s commitment to promotion and protection of human rights is unwavering. There is hardly any country in the world, in similar level of development as Nepal, which has so comprehensively participated in international human rights instruments and mechanisms.
We are just a least developed country but are a party to all but two core human rights conventions – quite a heavy set of obligations compared to any developing country standard.
We are among the few least developed countries that has a robust and broadly mandated National Human Rights Commission accredited ‘A’ by the International Coordination Committee of National Human Rights Institutes.
What more can one would expect from a least developed, land locked country in a very preliminary stage of development?
I, therefore, submit that while commenting on Nepal’s human rights aspects, the long strides it has made in institutionalizing the culture of human rights be duly appreciated.
Comments have been made about transitional justice.
When decade-long armed conflict ended in 2006, we all, including the international community, celebrated the journey towards peace and start of Nepal’s home grown peace process.
We all know that transitional justice is an integral part of the peace process as envisaged in the Comprehensive Peace Accord.  Institutional mechanisms – Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission for Investigation of the Disappeared Persons – are working as per the mandate provided in the respective laws.
I want to make it clear that work by the transitional justice mechanisms is not meant to undermine our commitment towards human rights. Nevertheless we all have to accept that transitional justice has its own complexity. We cannot completely ignore the complex character and dynamics of the whole peace process. We are mindful of the fact that rigid legality should not lead to an unravelling of the progress we have so far made in transforming society from conflict to peace and undermine our efforts to sustain peace. Our policy is clear on this.
Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
In our external relations, we pursue the policy of friendship with all.
In neighbourhood, our consistent effort is to maintain cooperative and friendly relations with the two friendly neighbours – India and the People’s Republic of China.
Both our neighbours are making tremendous progress in economic growth, infrastructure development, science and technology and in transforming life standards of their people. We are inspired by their progress. Situated between them, our legitimate desire is to benefit from their prosperity and this pragmatism is guiding our deep and comprehensive engagement with them.
Rt. Hon’ble Prime Minister paid State Visit to India on February 19-24, 2016 and official visit to the People’s Republic of China on March 20-27, 2016. Both of these visits were successful. We have concluded a number of important agreements with India and China including on transit, connectivity and infrastructure development during the visit and our focus will be on timely implementation of these agreements.
Since I last interacted with you in this format on January 12, the uneasy situation at Nepal-India border points have been resolved and trade, transit and supplies have been normalized.
We attach importance to our bilateral relations with all SAARC fellow member states and are actively engaged with the process of greater regional integration and cooperation. We also attach importance to our relations with member states of BIMSTEC.
Our relations with development partners, major powers and other friendly countries are important for us in many ways.
We enjoy solidarity and cooperation with developing world and we continue to work collectively for the advancement of common interests.
We do not compare our relations with one country with that of the other. Bases and factors determining friendship and cooperation different for each country and each bilateral relation is unique.
Nepal continues to remain a responsible member of international community and participate actively in international efforts to make the world better.
We have contributed to the best of our ability to make the world safer, more peaceful and prosperous. We are a significant contributor to the UN Peacekeeping and have been strong supporter of all international efforts for disarmament and arms control. We have condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and have supported the call for a robust international instrument against terrorism.
We signed the Paris Agreement on Climate Change – I myself had the privilege to do so on behalf of the Government of Nepal. We are committed to implement the deal. We continue to advocate for the cause of LDCs’ development and will have high level participation in the review process of the Istanbul Programme of Action.
Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
The achievements we have made so far in empowering people, institutionalizing democracy and promoting an inclusive society have not been an easy take. What we have achieved may not be complete but behind these, there is already a saga of struggle and sacrifices.
Nepal had its first test of democracy six decades back. However, we could not institutionalize the democratic achievements in our political system It was difficult to bring democracy and more difficult to sustain it. We do not want to lose this time what we have gained. We have remained thankful for the high level of support and solidarity received from the international community in every step of the peace process and constitution making. The same level of support is needed now more than before as we step into the stage of implementing the Constitution.
We are glad that international community has shown so much interest on Nepal’s constitution and peace process. We would expect similar interest in other aspects of Nepal’s critical needs, particularly our developmental needs like vital infrastructure and trade and productive capacity.
We are confident that your support in these areas would yield a more concrete result in transforming our society and making people’s life better. Our development will ultimately be in your interest as this will mean less ‘burden’ on the development partners.
Finding fault alone will not help. True partnership means support, solidarity and appreciation of what has been gained and encouragement for continuous improvement.
With political issues now resolved, Nepal wants to fully focus on economic agenda. We need your concrete support not only in the form of development cooperation but also in encouraging your private sectors to invest in productive areas in Nepal.
With a conducive political and constitutional foundation, we are now ready to take off on the path of development and prosperity with your strong support.
Thank you for your kind attention.

Statement delivered by Honorable Mr. Kamal Thapa, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, at the High-Level Thematic Debate on Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals at the UN General Assembly

Statement delivered by Honorable Mr. Kamal Thapa, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, at the High-Level Thematic Debate on Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals at the UN General Assembly
(New York, 21 April 2016)
Mr. President,
 
I thank you for your leadership in convening the high-level debates on important pillars of the UN, and I am pleased to participate in today’s thematic debate on achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
I align my statement with those of the Groups of 77, LDCs and LLDCs, and wish to highlight some points from the perspective of the land-locked, mountainous and least developed economy of Nepal, which is also emerging from conflict.
Last year in New York, we adopted the ambitious 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We did so with great determination to leave no one behindwhile transforming the lives of our people and the planet.
Also last year, Nepal confronted profound challenges: the devastating earthquakes and the obstruction of supplies.
As Nepal struggles to recover and build back better, we are acutely aware of the immense impedimentsto the sustainability of our development, such as landlockedness, climate change, natural disasters, shortfall in capacities and weak means-of-implementation.
Accordingly, we have prepared the groundwork to implement the new Agenda:
First, we have made good progress on the MDGs; we will build on that success as well as on lessons learned.
Second, we have promulgated a rights-based constitution,which provides a solid foundation for our development endeavours; we will make the best use of it.On this, I am very happy to inform this august gathering that the new constitution drafted by the elected representatives of the Nepalese people incorporates universally accepted democratic and inclusive values and norms, which help create conducive environment for implementation of the SDGs.
Third, we have prepared a national assessment report on existing policies and the institutional environment with respect to each SDG. This report informsthe formulation of a new development planand its implementation beginning mid-July this year.
Fourth, our national effort to combat climate change is robust and supports the SDGs, and
Fifth, we aspire to smooth and sustainable graduation from LDC status by 2022.
Mr. President,
We are aware that implementing the Agenda is ultimately a national responsibility.
To enhance our capability for the purpose, we are ready for collaboration with the international community for means of implementation: financial resources, technology, and partnerships, so as to complement our own efforts under national leadership and ownership.
At home, our collaboration involves meaningful partnerships among the public, private and the cooperative sectors as well as academia, media and civil society.
Mr. President,
Global effort and cooperation at the current level are not adequate to help disadvantaged countries to come out of their difficulties.
Most LDCs have remained LDCsfortoo long; landlocked countries have suffered immensely; smallest and weakest countries continue to bear the weight of action and inaction of others, especially in climate change.
These are also the core issues that deserve serious attention in discussions on United Nationsreform so that it remains ‘fit for purpose’. We underline the need to strengthenthe development pillar of the UN, and to ensure that we are ‘delivering as one’ for the efficiency and effectiveness of the programme.
Mr. President,
The 2030 Agenda is a result of the special momentum generated by special collaboration.
We need to keep up the momentum; we need to promote solidarity and partnership; and we need to focus on early and effective implementation with all our energy, resources and wisdom to transformthe lives of our peoples. Nepal is committed to playing its part in that vision.
 
I thank you for your kind attention.

प्रेस  नोट
(१४ चैत्र २०७२, त्रिभुवन अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय विमानस्थल, काठमाण्डौ)
उपस्थित  सञ्चारकर्मी  मित्रहरू,
मित्रराष्ट्र जनवादी गणतन्त्र चीनका प्रधानमन्त्री महामहिम ली खच्याङ्गको मैत्रिपूर्ण निमन्त्रणामा चीनको औपचारिक भ्रमण पूरा गरी आज म स्वदेश फर्किएको छु।
भ्रमणबाट प्राप्त महत्वपूर्ण उपलव्धिका बारेमा भ्रमण दलका सञ्चारकर्मी मित्रहरुबाट निरन्तररुपमा समाचार सम्प्रेषण भएको हुँदा यहाँहरु पनि सो सम्वन्धमा जानकार नै हुनुहुन्छ।
संविधान निर्माणसँगै मुलुकले प्राप्त गरेको राजनैतिक स्थिरताको जगमा मुलुकको आर्थिक सामाजिक विकास गरी समुन्नत नेपाल निर्माण गर्ने दिशामा सरकार प्रतिवद्ध रहेको छ।
सरकार मुलुकको सार्वभौमसत्ता, स्वतन्त्रता, भौगोलिक अखण्डताको रक्षा एवं राष्ट्रिय हित र स्वाभिमानको अभिवृद्धि गर्दै तीव्रतर आर्थिक समुन्नतिका लागि आन्तरिक तथा वाह्य श्रोत र साधनको अधिकतम परिचालन गर्ने नीति र कार्ययोजनाका साथ अगाडि बढिरहेको छ।
यसक्रममा छिमेकी मुलुकहरुको सद्‍भाव तथा सहयोग र उनीहरुसँगको सहकार्य सुनिश्चित गर्ने प्रयासको सिलसिलामा मैले छिमेकी मित्रराष्ट्रहरुको भ्रमण गरेको छु। छिमेकीहरुसँगको सम्वन्ध सुदृढ गर्दै पारस्परिक सम्मान, समानता र आपसी हितका आधारमा द्विपक्षीय सहयोगलाई अगाडि बढाउने सरकारको घोषित नीति बारे सबैलाई जानकारी नै छ ।
परापूर्व कालदेखि हार्दिकता, सद्‍भाव र मित्रतामा आधारित नेपाल-चीन सम्वन्धलाई अझ सुदृढ गर्दै नयाँ गति र उचाई प्रदान गर्नु एवं मुलुकको आर्थिक विकास र समुन्नतिका लागि नेपाल-चीन आर्थिक सहयोगको दीर्घकालीन खाका तयार गर्नु मेरो चीन भ्रमणको प्रमुख उद्देश्य रहेको थियो।

भ्रमणको अवसरमा चीनियाँ उच्च नेतृत्वसँग भएको सारभूत र व्यापक छलफल पछि विभिन्न सम्झौता/समझदारी पत्रमा हस्ताक्षर भएको छ भने नेपाल चीन सम्वन्धलाई आगामी दिनका लागि दिशानिर्देश गर्न संयुक्त विज्ञप्ति समेत जारी भएको छ।
दुबै पक्षबीच हस्ताक्षर भै आदान प्रदान गरिएका सम्झौता तथा समझदारीपत्रहरुबाट नेपाल-चीनबीच विद्यमान आर्थिक सहयोगको दायरालाई फराकिलो बनाउन मद्दत पुग्नेछ । भ्रमणको अवसरमा सम्पन्न पारवहन यातायात सम्झौताले भूपरिवेष्टित मुलुकका रुपमा नेपालको समुन्द्रसम्म पुग्ने अधिकार र चीनियाँ भूभागबाट निर्वाधरुपमा पारवहन स्वतन्त्रता पाउने कुरालाई प्रत्याभूत गरेको छ। यो सम्झौता यस भ्रमणको एक महत्वपूर्ण उपलव्धि हो।

उच्चस्तरीय भ्रमणको आदान प्रदानबाट दुबै देशबीच विद्यमान सम्वन्धलाई विस्तार एवं थप मजवुत बनाउन दुबै देश सहमत भएका छन् । यसै सन्दर्भमा मैले सम्माननीय राष्ट्रपतिका तर्फबाट महामहिम चीनियाँ राष्ट्रपति र मेरा तर्फबाट महामहिम चीनियाँ प्रधानमन्त्रीलाई नेपाल भ्रमणको निम्ता दिएको छु। चीनको उच्च राजनैतिक नेतृत्वबाट सन्‌ २०१६ मा नेपालको भ्रमण हुने अपेक्षा राखेको छु।
भ्रमणका अवसरमा मैले वेइजिङ्ग, सियान र छेन्दूमा नेपाल र चीनका व्यापारिक प्रतिनिधिहरुले आयोजना गरेको Nepal Investment Forum लाई सम्वोधन गरी नेपालका उत्पादनशील क्षेत्रमा लगानी गर्न आव्हान गरेको छु ।संविधान जारी भै राजनैतिक स्थायित्व तर्फ मुलुक अग्रसर भएको अवस्थामा नेपालमा लगानीको उपयुक्त वातावरण बनेको र सरकार लगानी  सुरक्षाका लागि प्रतिवद्ध रहेको सन्देश सञ्चार गर्न उक्त कार्यक्रमहरु फलदायी भएका छन्‍ ।
यसैगरी बेईजिङ्गको Renmin University, सियानको Xi’an Medical University र छेन्दूको Sichuan University मा आयोजित वेग्लावेग्लै कार्यक्रमहरुमा प्राज्ञिक वर्ग र विद्यार्थीहरुलाई सम्वोधन गरे।नेपाल-चीन सम्वन्धका विविध विषयहरु र खासगरी शैक्षिक र साँस्कृतिक क्षेत्रका सम्वन्धहरु वारे आफ्ना धारणाहरु राख्ने र अन्तरक्रिया गर्ने अवसर प्राप्त भयो। यसबाट जनस्तरमा सम्वन्ध विस्तार गर्न एवं चीनियाँ जनताका माझ नेपालप्रतिको सद्‍भाव र सहयोगको भावनालाई अझ सवल बनाउन मद्दत पुगेको छ ।
छेन्दूमा रहदाँ सन् २००८ को भूकम्पबाट क्षतिग्रस्त Wenchuan County मा भएको सफल पुनर्निर्माण कार्यको अवलोकन गरियो।हाम्रो पुनर्निर्माण तथा आगामी दिनको विकास कार्यका लागि उक्त अवलोकनबाट महत्वपूर्ण अनुभव हासिल गर्ने अवसर प्राप्त भयो।
क्षेत्रीय संयन्त्रहरुसँगको कार्यक्रमः
बेइजिङ्ग वसाईको अवसरमा Shanghai Cooperation Organization मा नेपाल डायलग पार्टनर बन्ने सम्वन्धी समझदारीपत्रमा मेरो उपस्थितिमा हस्ताक्षर भयो। यसबाट संगठनका सदस्य राष्ट्रहरुसँग आपसी चासो र हितका विषयहरुमा सम्वन्ध विस्तार गर्ने अवसर हामीलाई प्राप्त हुनेछ ।
यसैगरी बेइजिङ्ग रहँदा एसियन पूर्वाधार लगानी बैंकका अध्यक्षले मसँग भेटघाट गर्नु भयो। बैंकको संस्थापक सदस्यको नाताले नेपालले प्राप्त गर्न सक्ने सहयोगको सम्वन्धमा विचारको आदान-प्रदान भयो।
चीन भ्रमणका अवसरमा हाइनान प्रान्तको बोआओ शहरमा आयोजित Boao Forum for Asia: Annual Conference 2016 मा सहभागी भए । उक्त फोरमलाई समकक्षी चीनियाँ प्रधानमन्त्री तथा विभिन्न मुलुकका सरकार प्रमुख तथा नेताहरुको उपस्थितिमा  Asia’s New Future: New Vision, New Dynamics विषयमा संवोधन गर्ने अवसर प्राप्त भयो। मैले आफ्नो संवोधनमा अबको विकास प्रक्रिया जनमुखी, जिम्मेवारीपूर्ण र दीगो हुनुपर्ने, अन्तरदेशीय सहयोगको ढाँचा समन्यायीक ढंगबाट सबैलाई लाभ दिन सक्ने खालको हुनुपर्ने, कुनै पनि मुलुक विकासको प्रक्रियाबाट विमुख हुने अवस्था आउन नहुने एवं गरिबी निवारण नगरी शान्ति प्राप्त नहुने जस्ता विचारहरु राखेँ।
भ्रमणको समग्र विश्लेषण: 
चीन भ्रमणका अवसरमा भएका उच्चस्तरीय भेटघाट र छलफलबाट दुई देशबीच आपसी विश्वास एवं समझदारीमा अभिवृद्धि हुन गई राजनीतिक सम्वन्ध थप सुदृढ हुन गएको; पारवहन, यातायात, भौतिक पूर्वाधार, लगानी, उर्जा, पर्यटन जस्ता विषयहरुमा भएका छलफल र सम्पन्न सम्झौता समझदारीबाट दीर्धकालीन दृष्टिकोणबाट आर्थिक सहयोगको खाका तयार भएको तथा सहयोगको दायरा फराकिलो भएको तथा प्राज्ञिक र व्यापारिक समुदायसँगको अन्तरक्रिया र छलफलबाट जनस्तरको सम्वन्धको आधारशीला थप मजवुत भएको छ।
सबै मित्रराष्ट्रहरुसँग समानता र पारस्परिक हितका आधारमा विद्यमान सम्वन्धलाई थप सुदृढ र विस्तार गर्दै लैजाने एवं छिमेकीहरुसँगको सम्वन्धलाई एक अर्कासँग तुलना नगर्ने हाम्रो नीति स्पष्ट छ ।
नेपालको विकास हामी आफैले गर्ने हो। अबको प्रमुख काम पुनर्निर्माण र समग्र विकासका लागि हाम्रा मित्रराष्ट्रहरुसँग सहमतिमा पुगेका विषयहरुको प्रभाकारी कार्यान्वयन नै हो।त्यसतर्फ हामीले चाल्ने कदमबाट नै मुलुकको दीर्घकालीन समुन्नति तथा नेपाली जनताको सर्वतोमुखी प्रगति सुनिश्चित हुन्छ भन्ने मेरो विश्वास छ ।
अन्त्यमा, यस औपचारिक भ्रमणको अवधिमा चीन सरकारबाट प्रदान गरिएको स्वागत, सत्कार, आतिथ्यता तथा सदाशयताका लागि म, मेरो प्रतिनिधिमण्डल तथा व्यक्तिगततर्फबाट  चीनका महामहिम राष्ट्रपति, महामहिम प्रधानमन्त्री, चीन सरकारका सम्वद्ध सबै निकायहरु, हाइनान, सान्सी र सिचुवान प्रान्तका नेता एवं पदाधिकारीहरु र सम्पूर्ण चीनियाँ जनताहरुप्रति हार्दिक कृतज्ञता तथा धन्यवाद ज्ञापन गर्दछु।
धन्यवाद ।

Statement by Rt. Hon. Prime Minister of Nepal at Boao Forum for Asia, 2016
Posted onMarch 24, 2016March 24, 2016 

Statement by Rt. Hon. Prime Minister
at Boao Forum for Asia, 2016
“Asia’s New Future: New Dynamics, New Vision”
 
Your Excellency Mr. Li Keqiang,
Your Excellencies Heads of State and Government,
Mr. Secretary-General,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
 
It is my distinct pleasure to address the Boao Annual Forum-2016.
The Forum provides a platform for the cross fertilization of ideas.
Ideas for Asia. Ideas of Asia.
I thank the organizer and also the Government of the People’s Republic of China for the kind invitation.
I bring you humble greetings from Nepal; the land where Buddha was born and induced the world to walk upon the path of peace.
I bring you warm wishes from the people of Nepal; people full of hope and potentials.
Asia has been the land of multiple civilizations, all of them equally great and all of them equally rich.
It must continue to be the land of multiple and distinct civilizations, coexisting together in harmony.
 
Distinguished Participants, 
The emergence of Asia as the global economic leader has brought Asia in spotlight of the changing world order of the twenty first century.
To give a powerful boost to the global economy, the world looks today at Asia’s economic dynamism.
The extraordinary performance of the Asian economies suggests the latitude of Asia’s prospects.
The relentless effort of Asia till today suggests the inevitability of Asia’s bright future.
Advancements in innovation and technology have been encouraging, have been opening new avenues for the development.
The momentous developments in information and communication technology; significant achievements in industrial productions bear potentials to vitalize the economic performance of Asia; to galvanize the future of Asia.
And such innovations must serve the cause of human progress. Technology must be accessible to all of the states without any prohibitive constraints.
To construct a prosperous and flourishing future by harnessing the dynamics of Asia; our efforts must build a cooperation model which will equitably distribute the opportunities and benefits.
Our collective vision must create a cooperation model which will enable a free flow of ideas, unimpeded links of trade, and an enduring instance of win-win situation; a cooperation model where the states do not exploit the vulnerabilities of others.
The vision for Asia must be accommodative and inclusive.
 
Distinguished Participants, 
The dream of Asia’s future, the dream of peace and prosperity will be a failed cause if any of the Asian States is left behind.
Make No Mistake, the sustainability of development in Asia will fall apart if the development is not inclusive.
Our pursuit for ‘common destiny’ will go misspent if anyone is left behind.  Make No Mistake, the Asian future should rest on the citadel of inclusiveness.
Without any doubt, Asia is emerging as the powerhouse of global economy.
The markets are flourishing, industries are growing, jobs (are) being created and many of the Asians have been lifted out of the poverty.
Yet, the vicious circle of poverty still stares at courtyard of Asia.
Make No Mistake, Ladies and Gentlemen, Peace and Poverty cannot go together.
Growth of Asia must not be narrow in dimension.
Rise of Asia must not be extractive in approach.
Ascent of Asia must not be fragile in structure.
Responsibility lies on us to uphold the vision that the dimension of Asian growth is broad enough; the approach of Asian rise is inclusive enough and the structure of Asian ascent is robust enough.
 
Distinguished Participants, 
Recently, in our pursuit to embrace the aspirations of Nepalese people, we promulgated a democratic and inclusive constitution through the Constituent Assembly elected by the people of Nepal.
I would like to express sincere appreciation to all the states of Asia for their sincere support to our landmark endeavor.
In conclusion, this is the huge moment for Asia, to seize the opportunities, to unleash the potentials and to march ahead towards new future, with new dynamics and new vision.
This gathering will bring the ideas together, will bring the commitments together, and will inject dynamism as well as novel vision.
I am confident that we will, together, make a headway towards a prosperous future, a shared future of Asia.
Thank You!

Remarks by Rt. Hon. Prime Minister of Nepal to the Business Community in Beijing, China
Posted onMarch 22, 2016March 22, 2016 

Remarks by Rt. Hon. Prime Minister to the
Nepalese and Chinese Business Community in Beijing, China
22 March 2016
Mr Yin Zhonghua, Vice Chairman of CCPIT
Distinguished members of the business communities
Friends from Media,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I am delighted to be here today and speak a few words to a distinguished gathering of business communities both from Nepal and China. Thank you for making excellent arrangements for this programme.
That a business delegation is accompanying me during this visit means the importance we attach to our economic relations with China. As connection matters in business, I believe the Nepalese businessmen staying in China could play a pivotal role in further deepening the economic and commercial engagements between our two countries.
Nepal and China are good friends and reliable partners sharing exceptionally warm and cordial relations through ages. No amount of words, however powerful, can truly describe the goodwill that we nurture towards each other and the esteem in which we hold each other. History, tradition, cultural values and geography link us inextricably, and our destiny is intertwined. This makes the case of collaboration and cooperation all the more important.
The world is watching China, and watching with interest and curiosity not because it is big in size, but because it is emerging at a pace not seen in history. The global economy itself is well integrated with Chinese economy. Then, how can we remain aloof or afford of being delinked from these opportunities? We would surely like to reap benefit by integrating our economy in the most beneficial way.
Present-day China is a wonder of economic development popularly known as ‘China Miracle’. It has lifted the masses of humanity out of abject poverty within the short span of time– second to none in the history of human development.
China was a source of over 114 billion US$ FDI outflow in 2014. Though the competition for FDI attraction is fierce among the developing countries, we are destined to be the natural partners in such venture being the immediate neighbors. I will reflect on details later why Nepal could be a natural choice for the Chinese investors.
Collectively, the Chinese tourists themselves are branded as global product worth of over US$ 100 billion every year. All countries try to tap the economic opportunities of such products. Nepal has a lot to attract tourists. This sector warrants the active collaborations of our entrepreneurs and investors. Jointly, we can develop it as an exclusive brand for the Chinese tourists.
Nepal recently joined Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) established under the Chinese initiatives; we became the part of process of the ‘Silk Road Economic Belt and 21st Century Maritime Silk Road’ – a noble initiative taken by the Chinese leadership to revive the traditional silk route in the changed context.The Bank as well the Belt and Road Initiative could serve as cannels of finance for infrastructure development, improve connectivity and facilitate trade and investment across Asia and beyond.
These initiatives promise to create a win-win cooperation in economic and trade sectors. Moreover, they are also critical today to strengthen infrastructure and connectivity in Asia and beyond.We are ready to make our commensurate efforts to unbundle the package of opportunity by initiating appropriate measures.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
With the completion of constitution writing process, Nepal has now embarked on the new path of economic development and prosperity. Unleash the economic potentials of the country is our top priority. I am here with you to discuss the ways and means of forging partnership. Nepalese people are eager and ready to contribute to their part for the sake of economic growth, development and prosperity to sustain and consolidate the hard fought political gains.
The Constitution of Nepal itself lays the policy foundation of encouraging foreign capital and technological investment in areas of import substitution and export promotion. It also has the policy to encourage and mobilize such investment in infrastructure development.
Nepal is pursuing a liberal economic policy. Investors are key actors, innovators, entrepreneurs and leaders whereas the government works only as an enabler or a facilitator by letting the private sector to take the helm of economic affairs of the country. We have defined private sector as partner for development and are promoting public private partnership.
Like anywhere in the world, we are also building greater convergence on the national development agendas among the major political forces of the country. Development today has now become the responsibility of the Government, private sector and cooperatives of the country. In Nepal, there is growing realization that the untapped potentials of the country can be harnessed through the effective mobilization of foreign investment.With a view to improving and facilitating trade and investment, we have reduced tariffs, simplified tax regimes and focused on the development and operation of trade related infrastructure.
Export and import rules and procedures have been made market based, market friendly, open and liberal. Trade facilitation measures have been improved. We have made several policy provisions for the foreign investors to provide maximum security to their investment. Minimal tax slabs, no income tax on dividends and export earnings as well as exemption of tax, duty and fee on the products, machinery, equipment, tools and raw materials used by an export industry are some of the policy provisions to ensure high return from FDI. We permit full repatriation of income earned from the investment.
We have made administrative procedures simple. Our government machinery is easily accessible. We have the single window facility for the foreign investors.
Investment Board has been established to facilitate large scale investments. Board negotiates projects and provides one window services. Simplified and liberal visa rules apply to investors and their family members. The same rule is applicable to reinvestment. Foreign companies registered in Nepal can purchase, own and sell land.
We provide sector-specific incentives of various kinds and scope. Law ensures that no private industry will be nationalized. Industrial relations have been improved. Labour law is being reformed.
Establishing the cross border economic zones and port facilities helps facilitate commercial activities. Investing within SEZ has multiple benefits that include flexible and investment friendly labour law. Both of our government are actively considering the development of cross border facilities and establishing SEZ near the border.
Consumer market is growing with the rise in middle class population.  Our financial sector is becoming robust and growing very fast. Banks are lending at competitive interest rate. The Government has requested the Chinese side to consider establishing branches of Chinese banks in Nepal to facilitate Chinese investment.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Workforce is our asset. The country is passing through the phase of demographic dividend. Every year over 500 thousand youths enter into job market.
Government is vigorously pursuing the Chinese language training opportunity for Nepalese people both in Nepal and China.This will eventually overcome the communication barriers for our engagements. Every year, there are hundreds of Nepalese students are graduating from Chinese Universities in technical fields. They could be the natural choice for the Chinese investors to expand their business and investment in Nepal.
Labor cost is low and competitive. Nepali people are known for hard work and honesty. If matched with the dedication of Chinese people, we can make bonanza.
Rate of return is high. Some joint ventures are making decent profit within the short span of time.
The 2ndphase of reforms are undergoing to further open up our economy. The Government is also committed to sort out the hindrances of economic development and make reform a continuous process.
Location of our country is also an advantage that ensures access to market and opportunities. Chinese investors can take benefits of location, cheap labor and production cost to produce some of their products in Nepal. Moreover, such investment naturally enjoys the benefits of preferential schemes offered by developed and developing countries to Nepal. Most of our products enjoy zero tariff in developed and some developing countries.
Chinese investors can have easy and quick access in vast South Asian market through Nepal. They can make their products cheaper filled with south Asian taste if produced in Nepal.
China is our 2ndlargest trading partner, 2nd largest source of FDI and important source of tourists. Cross border roads and other connectivity are being improved. Border facilities for trade and other human interactions are improving.
Our doors are open for investment in almost every sector. These include manufacturing, hydropower, tourism, services, IT, mining and agro based industries.
Hydropower could be number one choice. Nepal have massive hydro power generation capacity. Solar, wind and biomass have also good possibility.Chinese investment in mega projects can open up a new chapter in our economic relations. This can have the potential of being a game changer for our common good.
Tourism is an attractive sector for investors in Nepal. Nepal is gifted with beauty of nature and treasures of culture and civilization. Over the years, tourists from China are increasing. With the rising standard of living, more and more Chinese people are looking some natural places for recreation, adventure and spiritual growth, Nepal can be their first destination given the natural beauty, closeness and hospitable people and culture. It is an opportunity to invest in facilities to cater needs of growing number. Infrastructure is key.
We are developing regional international airports at two prime touristic hubs of Pokhara and Lumbini. Given the limited resources available in the country to overcome the towering task of development and nation building, we need massive investment in human resources, institutions and infrastructures to bring about economic transformation.
We want to overcome the vicious circle of poverty and underdevelopment. Government alone has limited capacity and resources. We invite the private sector, domestic and foreign, to invest resources, produce goods and services and create jobs.
My government is committed to take reform policies further. We expect private sector’s willingness to invest. We extend all needful support to facilitate your investment in Nepal.
Let me once again thank the organizers for organizing this program to promote investment, trade and other economic as well as commercial interactions between our two countries.
Thank you very much.

Statement delivered by Rt. Hon. Prime Minister of Nepal at Renmin University, Beijing
Posted onMarch 22, 2016March 22, 2016 

Statement by Rt. Hon. Prime Minister at Renmin University, Beijing 
On the theme “Nepal-China Relations in the Context of One Belt- One Road Initiative”
Beijing, 22 March 2016
 
Prof. Liu Wei, President of Renmin University of China,
Esteemed Professors, academics and students,
Distinguished Friends,
Ladies and Gentlemen
I feel honoured to be here and speak to this gathering of intellectuals, youthful students and friends of Nepal. I express my sincere gratitude to Mr. President for his generous invitation to join all of you at this University; the People’s university which has been a home to several outstanding scholars, has been a fountain of knowledge and source of wisdom, and whose alumni have provided impetus to the unprecedented development of the People’s Republic of China.
In its glorious history of more than seven decades since the foundation of Shanbei Public School, the university has taken a leading role in higher education, not only in China but globally. I feel profoundly impressed to be here at the university whose foundation was guided by genesis of new China, which was established out of North China University in 1950 and received care and guidance from the enlightened leaderships, including that of Chairman Mao.
Specializing in humanities and social sciences, it has cultivated notable alumni, and produced a large number of cadres who contributed in the rise of China.
With its motto of “Seeking Truths from Facts”, the university has made significant research achievements in the past and continues to do so.
Standing here at the university with exceptional historical legacy, it is indeed a matter of pleasure to meet this cross-section of professionals and students, who are in the incessant pursuit of “Seeking Truth from Facts”.
Almost forty-three years ago, in the age of my prime youth, I was arrested and jailed, without any fair trail, by the autocratic rulers and suppressive regime to fulfill their hidden interest and prolong their autocratic regime. Their sole motto was: crush the truth and protect their selfish instinct. For that, they alleged me of being an anti-national element. I continued to reject with strong belief that might can’t be right and I never surrendered myself to that belief rather chose to fight against the autocratic regime without any fear of my life. I believe so because might is ephemeral and truth is permanent and eternal. I was indicted for committing heinous crime that was too deemed destabilizing for the existing social order. And you know what my crime was?  To “Seek Truth from Facts”!
For the crime of “Seeking Truth from Facts”, I was sentenced to harsh imprisonment for fourteen years with four years of solitary confinement. However I did not let that dark episode of my life to drain my energy away. I did not let that period of severe detention to decimate my determination. The hope in me did not succumb to the torture. The youth in me did not yield to those reactionaries. The cruelty afflicted by those who sought to silence my pursuit for truth, my quest for transformation, did not melt my resolve.
And at the end, it was ‘the truth’ that prevailed.  It is ‘the truth’ that will continue to prevail.
And, allow me, from this podium, to congratulate, the prestigious university of yours for keeping pursuit of truth alive; for keeping the beacon of truth. Thus, from cave to space, from cradle to cabin, Beijing leads civilization, knowledge and development.
Ladies and Gentlemen, Dear Friends,
Asia has been the land of great philosophers, the land of passionate truth-seekers, the land of multiple civilizations, all of them equally great and all of them equally rich.
It is our Asia where the greatest of human civilizations flourished and guided the humanity across the path of innovation and evolution. It is our Asia, where great Masters and Saints were born, and showed the world the light of peace, the avenue of wisdom, the path of virtue and the way of ‘de’(德Chinese for virtue) or virtue. 
It is our Asia where the diligence and dedication of our forebears conceived an unshakable foundation of history. A foundation infused with creative ingenuity, a foundation infused with scientific curiosity and a foundation infused with foresighted leadership.
Our ancestors guided the world through the process of innovation and evolution. They were innovators, visionary and leaders whose legacy is an asset to the whole of Asia and the world. They steered the raft of transformation with profound success, even though waters of history were turbulent sometime. They carried the torch of determination even though the path of history was dark sometime. Their efforts for development were tireless, their commitments resolute, and their leadership exemplary. They risked their life to breathe life into the dream of prosperous and developed Asia.
The responsibility lies on us to ensure that the raft of our creative ancestors won’t sink and the torch won’t extinguish.  And education will indeed nurture the talents who will walk upon the path laid down by our progenitors.
Education has the ability to cultivate the human potential to the pinnacle of creativity. Education has might to nurse innovativeness and skills, much needed to fuel the engine of economic growth and development.
It is education that ultimately molds the robust bricks essential to build the edifice of developed nation. And I strongly believe, Dear Students, you will make best use of the opportunity you have been provided with at this glorious university.
Ladies and Gentlemen, Dear Friends,
Our nations, Nepal and China, the lands of Lord Buddha and Great Confucius have a long history of harmonious relationship with each other. Our nations had cooperated in the areas of culture as well as commerce, had exchanges in the areas of trade as well as civilizations. The relationship dates back to antiquity, rooted in our histories that coexisted together.
Today, in our contemporary times, that cooperation has emerged more intensely. The relations have been deepened with collaboration more diversified in approach, exchanges more broadened in scope and linkage more strengthened in resolve.
Our friendly relations have been firmly fortified on the foundations of Panchasheel. The sovereign equality, non-interference, and respect for each other’s sensitivities have guided our stable friendship.
As a friendly neighbor, Nepal, has always been well aware of the sensitivities of China. Nepal adheres strongly to the ‘One-China Policy’, and has not allowed its land to be used, under any pretext, against China.  And it will continue to keep this commitment firm and intact.
Similarly, the People’s Republic of China has respected our sovereignty and supported our development endeavors. Our two nations have been all-weather friends, friends at the time of distress as well as at the time of comfort.
The generous assistance extended by China in projects of infrastructure build-up has aided development endeavors of Nepal. The investment ventures by the Chinese firms, the dynamic engagement in trade relations and technical cooperation has aided our pursuits for development. However, we must take the scheme of economic cooperation to much higher level.
The increasing flow of tourists from China has contributed to the growth of our economy; and more importantly it has augmented the interactions among people, interactions between the cultures.
China remains one of the most preferred destinations for the students from Nepal. The increasing number of Nepalese students in China, brighten up the prospect for exchange of ideas, prospect for advancement of skills and a prospect for shared future.
With the rapid development of Tibet Autonomous Region of China, I believe that it will further boost trade and investment between our countries. It will ease the constraints of geography; will defy the every existing barriers.
As a land locked country with least developed economy, Nepal has multiple development challenges to conceive the prosperous future for nation. We need to boost investments, utilize resources and develop technology as well as innovation strategies. Investment will ease our constraints, resources will provide a manufacturing base, and technology will invoke the upward trajectory of development.
Nepal is seeking for the transformations in the quality of life for its people. We have pledged to broaden our industrial base as well as to modernize our agriculture. We have committed to harness the potential of hydropower development and generate energy, much needed to fuel our industries.  The markets are open for investment, welcoming for business. And I express my belief that Belt and Road initiative will relax the obstacles created by geography.
Dear Friends,
Last year, in 2015, we celebrated the diamond jubilee to mark the formalization of our diplomatic relations. And in the course of those amicable years and decades, our countries have explored the opportunities together, have voiced their commitments to realize the common aspirations, have exchanged the support when needed. Our people have stood with each other at the time of difficulties.
 However, the time has come to set higher and superior ambitions. Higher than the Mount Everest, and superior than the Great Wall. The time has come now to travel together into the united sphere of prosperity.
The initiative of One Belt-One Road, is a principal step to unleash our potentials to travel together into the cooperative sphere of prosperity.  To catalyze the convergence of our shared interests. And to weave a tapestry of connectivity that will deepen our cooperation.
Riding in the raft of this initiative we shall sail through the waters of the seamless cooperation to ultimately realize what President Xi called a “Community of Common Destiny”.
In the world order of twenty first century, we need to pursue mutually beneficial development ties without any of ideological prejudices, without any cynicism. And through this Belt and Road initiative we need to create inclusive cooperation, cooperation to realize positive-sum development, cooperation to establish Asia in the forefront of global dynamics.
This initiative will intensify the connectivity in all the manifestations. Connectivity of commerce as well as of cultures. Connectivity of interests as well as of benefits. Connectivity of infrastructures as well as of ideas. Connectivity of enterprises as well as of identities. Connectivity within and way beyond Asia.
Bringing the cultures and communities together, the Belt and Road initiative will step up the people to people bonds. It will bring us more closely to realize our shared destiny. A destiny of peace and harmony.
Nepal used to be an important thoroughfare of the historic commercial Silk route. It was a vibrant hub, an entrépot that connected China with the region of South Asia. And today, I believe, history has bestowed upon us the responsibility to revitalize that role. To augment the connectivity between our two countries and way beyond; the connectivity that encompasses over 60 countries and 4 billion people.
The economic growth and development of China is one of the inspiring success stories of our time. The initiative of Belt and Road will propel our prospects to benefit from the unprecedented transformation that is taking place in China, will cumulate the positive spillovers from development of China. Being the immediate neighbor of China, Nepal’s gain from this initiative will be remarkable.
Committed to actively participate in the process of enhancing connectivity, Nepal has joined various international as well as regional platforms. Our involvement in Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank as founding member is a recent example of our orientation towards development and connectivity.
Dear Friends, 
The successful process of Belt and Road initiative will unleash our potentials, will converge our interests. With the avenues opened for trade and investment, it will pave a route for prosperity, a route for development.
With the avenues opened for exchange of ideas and capitals, it will pave a road across which our countries will share the fruits of development.
With the avenues opened for unimpeded trade, it will pave a road to the welfare of all our people.
Well aware of those potentials, our countries signed a Memorandum of Understanding in December 2014 to jointly promote the Silk Road Economic Belt. Both sides have jointly agreed to deepen the connectivity through land highways and rail routes. And we must intensify our undertakings. We must revive the world’s promising economic route with the greatest of development potential.
We must realize the cusp of transformation in connectivity in our lifetime. As Chairman Mao wrote in his poem, we must “Seize the day and seize the hour”.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I take this opportunity to thank the Government of China, and its people as well, for the valuable assistance in both relief and rescue operations immediately after the devastating earthquake of April last year.
I am also keen to promote greater collaboration and cooperation between Renmin University and universities in Nepal for undertaking research in the areas of mutual concerns. The academic exchanges will inevitably lead us, and our leaders of tomorrow, to realize the shared destiny of peace and prosperity.
Before I conclude, I deem it important to share with you that I have had fruitful and productive discussions on Nepal-China relations with President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang yesterday. We have agreed to bring our relations to a newer height consistent with the trends of our time and as cherished by our people. Cross-border connectivity and infrastructure development; long-term economic partnership encompassing trade, investment, tourism; and, education and cultural exchanges are the key components of our cooperation for the days to come.
With this note, let me thank you, Prof. Liu Wei, and all other friends for this platform to share our ideas, to share our aspirations, and to explore the avenues of cooperation between our countries.
Thank you. Thank you very much for such a wonderful audience!

The promulgation of the new constitution marks the conclusion of the nationally-driven peace process initiated in 2006 and also institutionalizes significant democratic gains and aspirations of the people including federal and republican system.
Nepal respects the international community’s support and goodwill for peace, stability and prosperity. However, Nepal strongly views that the constitution making is an internal matter of the country and Nepal is capable of handling its internal affairs on its own.

Opening Statement by Hon’ble Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs Mr. Kamal Thapa at 23rd Session of Universal Periodic Review (Geneva, 4 November 2015)
Mr. President
Excellencies and representatives from member states and observers
Ladies and Gentlemen
 
I would like to begin by extending the warm greetings from the people and the Government of Nepal. I feel proud to share with you about the recent promulgation of our new constitution. This marks the conclusion of the peace process initiated in 2006. A new journey towards peace, stability and prosperity has now begun.
It is a great honour and privilege for me to present Nepal’s second UPR report to this august session. My delegation is pleased to have this opportunity to present this report on Nepal’s efforts towards fulfilling its international obligations and commitments on the issues of human rights, update the status of implementation of the recommendations that we accepted under the first UPR cycle, highlight our achievements, and share what remains to be done as well as the challenges and constraints we confront with. We look forward to having a productive interactive dialogue with the member states on these issues.
My delegation includes the Ambassador and Permanent Representative of the Permanent Mission of Nepal to the UN in Geneva, Secretaries of relevant Ministries and other Senior Officials from different agencies responsible for the formulation of human rights policies and implementation of human rights obligations.
 
Mr. President,
The new democratic and inclusive constitution was promulgated in Nepal on 20 September 2015 through the Constituent Assembly elected by the people in November 2013. With it, the long-cherished aspiration of the people to have a constitution written by their own representatives has been fulfilled. It has been made possible by the rigorous democratic exercises spanning over eight years conducted in an inclusive, transparent and participatory manner giving due consideration to Nepal’s vast diversity.
The promulgation of the new constitution marks the conclusion of the peace process as well as the historic political transition in Nepal. It has also institutionalized the federal democratic system of governance in the country, paving the way for political stability, sustainable peace and economic prosperity. It also significantly ensures inclusive democracy, pluralism, the rule of law, the democratic values of governance, representative and accountable government, social and economic justice and universally accepted human rights.
The new constitution guarantees substantive equality, and promotes human dignity, identity, and opportunity for all by ending all forms of discrimination and inequalities. This fundamental law of the land safeguards every right of persons, groups and communities, embracing multi-ethnic, multi-lingual, multi-cultural and diverse geographical specificities. It further aims to create an egalitarian society on the basis of the principles of proportional inclusion and participation, to ensure equitable economic opportunities, shared prosperity and social justice by ending discriminations related to class, ethnicity, region, language, religion and gender. For this, the proportional electoral system, inclusive representation of marginalized and disadvantaged communities in all State organs, positive discrimination and special provisions with regard to rights of women, Dalits,  Madheshis, Indigenous people, Tharus, Muslims, Persons with Disabilities, and minorities have been guaranteed in the Constitution.
The constitution has ambitiously broadened the scope of fundamental rights by ensuring a wide range of economic, social and cultural rights, including right to employment, right to food, right to housing, right of social justice, right of consumers and so on. Similarly, the directive principles of the constitution provide a framework for progressive realization of socio-economic rights and guidance for the successive governments to shape relevant laws and policies in line with those principles. In nutshell the constitution fully catches the spirit of universally accepted human rights and ensures their promotion and protection.
The new constitution has been significantly progressive in eliminating gender-based discrimination as well as empowering women through enhanced representation. It has ensured at least one-third representation of women in the Federal Parliament as well as the State Assembly and at least 40% representation of women at the lowest local level (Ward Committee). It has provisions for either Speaker or Deputy Speaker of the both Houses to be women, and also ensures right to lineage, right against all forms of exploitation, equal rights in the family matters and property, among others. The constitution has similar provisions for President and Vice-President ensuring that the two positions are held by persons of different sex or community. I wish to share with this august gathering that both the newly elected Speaker of the Parliament and President of the country are women. These historic elections have well reflected the spirit of the new inclusive constitution. Similarly, with a view to ensuring further inclusivity and empowerment of every community in society, the constitution has established and further strengthened various Commissions as independent constitutional bodies such as the National Women Commission, NationalDalit Commission, National Inclusion Commission, Indigenous people and Nationalities Commission,Madheshi Commission, Tharu Commission, and Muslim Commission.
The Government is committed to building on the solid foundation laid by the new constitution for the continued promotion and protection of human rights with necessary legal, institutional and administrative mechanisms. The formation and operationalization of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission as well as Commission on Enforced Disappearances also reflects the Government’s commitment to addressing the serious violation of human rights committed during the period of conflict, ending impunity and providing justice to victims as well as promoting sustainable peace, harmony and reconciliation in society based on the ground reality.
The independent and competent judiciary constantly defends and advances human rights agenda in the country including through judicial pronouncements and verdicts. The vibrant and free media, active civil society as well as the ever-growing awareness and consciousness of the general people about their rights continue to strengthen the human rights environment in the country.
Moreover, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) assumes central role in the protection and promotion of human rights with responsibility for independent investigation into all human rights violations as well as for overall monitoring of the human rights situation.
Mr. President,
In the last four years after the first UPR, the country has been able to accomplish many significant progresses in the overall human rights situation in the country. The basic elements of the rule of law and human rights are being incorporated into the periodic development plans. The rights-based approach has become an important consideration in every aspect of national life. By formulating an Action Plan on the implementation of UPR recommendations received in 2011, we have set stage for more effective outcomes of important human rights issues with significant monitorable progress.
The major accomplishments, the conclusion of the peace process and historic political transition in particular, have been nationally driven. The country’s experience in the democratic exercise and collaboration on the overall interest of the country during the peace process and political transition has been quite important and unique. While the prolonged political transition posed, at times, serious threats to the democratic norms and values, the rule of law, and enhanced the possibility of impunity particularly with the blurred distinction between criminal acts and political activities, it has also been an enlightening experience to guide further course of action. It is during this process that we realized the importance of compromise and flexibility to move forward from a context like ours, characterized by diversity and divergent views. The endogenous home-grown process that we pursued has proved to be an effective vehicle to arrive at a broader consensus on all critical issues, including the political system and governance. We are confident of our ability to resolve any conflicting issue with our own efforts and through peaceful means. Any disruption of this process as well as internal dynamics through any exogenous interest will only complicate matters.
It is with this conviction that the new Government is engaged in dialogue with the Madhesh-based political parties to win their confidence and resolve the differences within the constitutional framework. While the Government is quite serious and sensitive to their concerns, the nature and effects of continued agitation have been detrimental to our national interest and the overall wellbeing of the people.
In fact, we are currently at a very delicate situation resulting from the obstruction of essential supplies at the border points. Lives and livelihood of the entire population have been adversely affected; schools and hospitals also bear the brunt of the current circumstances exposing millions of children, elderly and sick persons to greater risk and vulnerabilities; the future of our children is at stake; our regional and international trade have been constrained; our industries are on the verge of collapse; the tourism sector has been hit hard; our economy has suffered a huge setback. If the current trend is not checked, the country is likely to experience an unjust and severe humanitarian crisis. This needs to be avoided. While we seek to address political problem through dialogue, the continuous obstructions at border points under any pretext has severely impeded the exercise of rights and freedom that Nepal is entitled under the international law as a land-locked country. As a Least Developed country that has emerged from a decade-long armed conflict followed by a protracted political transition and is just taking steps forward on a path of recovery and reconstruction with the support of the international community in the aftermath of the devastating earthquakes, the challenges and pressures besetting the nation and people at present are immensely painful.
Nevertheless, we are quite optimistic in view of our ability and competence to resolve our differences on our own for the national interest of the country. The present Government has already begun the process of dialogue and is confident of arriving at a mutually acceptable solution soon. Like many other democratic constitutions, the Constitution of Nepal is also a living and dynamic document that can be amended in accordance with the needs and aspirations of the people. It is flexible enough to adequately address the new context the nation faces through timely amendment.
We, the people of Nepal, are increasingly getting used to the significance and necessity of the democratic norms, rules and processes to resolve differences without undermining social harmony and cohesion that have been the defining features of our diverse society.
Mr. President,
The fundamental goal of the new Government, elected a few weeks back, is to effectively implement the new constitution by removing the structural and functional obstacles and challenges in the way of socio-economic transformation of the country. The Government has started to take necessary measures to formulate necessary legislative and policy tools needed for the smooth operationalization of the constitution. As the country ushers in a new era, we are also keen to give further momentum to our economic development agenda. Despite the huge devastation and setback caused by the recent earthquakes, Nepal will continue to pursue the goal of graduation from the LDC status by 2022, and becoming a middle income country by 2030.
I would like to express the Government’s commitment to keep up the spirit generated by the new constitution in advancing the cause of human rights.
 
Mr. President,
Despite consistent efforts in the promotion and protection of human rights, Nepal continues to confront challenges in meeting some of the desired targets and fulfilling obligations. Paucity of resources, land-locked situation, low level of economic development, rampant poverty, deprivation of basic needs and amenities, low level of education, among others, have adversely affected the implementation of action plans on human rights. Moreover, the prolonged political transition had also left negative impacts on creating conducive environment required for the promotion of human rights in the country. As the political transition has come to an end with the promulgation of the new constitution, the country is in a position to undertake further steps forward for the effective realization of all human rights by all with adequate support from the international community.
We stress the importance of strict adherence to the principles of universality, objectivity and non-selectivity by all human rights mechanisms under the United Nations. As democracy, development, peace, security and human rights are interdependent, they call for a holistic approach to address the human rights issues.  The efforts of the international community must, therefore, be geared towards creating an environment for the enjoyment of all human rights, including civil and political rights; social, cultural and economic rights; and the right to development. For a country like Nepal, the enjoyment of the right to development will have significant impact on the promotion of other rights. It is in this context that we attach huge importance to the effective and balanced implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted by the world leaders in September this year. The transformative ambition of the 2030 Agenda along with its focus, among others, on peace, equality and freedom offers a new hope and opportunity for the enjoyment of human rights by all.
Mr. President,
To conclude, I would like to reiterate our total and unflinching commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights. There is a greater awareness and positive outlook in the country among both the state and non-state actors about the value of human rights.
As I also consider the UPR as an opportunity to learn from others, I look forward to receiving your valuable inputs during your constructive engagement in the interactive dialogue. I am confident that with the greater understanding and support of the international community Nepal will continue to make significant progress in the days ahead.
I thank you for your kind attention.

Statement by Hon. Mr. Prakash Man Singh, Deputy Prime Minister and the leader of the delegation at the general debate of the 70th session of UNGA
New York ,01 October 2015
Mr. President,
Mr. Secretary-General,
Excellencies,
Distinguished Delegates,
I bring with me the warm greetings from the people and Government of Nepal to the distinguished delegates and best wishes for the success of the 70th anniversary of the world body. I congratulate His Excellency Mr. Mogens Lykketoft of Denmark on his unanimous election to the Presidency of the 70th session of the United Nations General Assembly. With his proven experience and skill, we are confident that he will guide our deliberations to a fruitful conclusion. My delegation wishes to place on record sincere gratitude to the President of the Sixty-ninth session of the Assembly, His Excellency Mr. Sam Kutesa of Uganda, for successfully guiding the business of the session, particularly in the run up to the UN Summit which adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development last week. Our tribute is also due to His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, Secretary-General of the United Nations, for his outstanding service to the Organization in these challenging times.
Mr. President,
The theme of the session ‘The UN at 70: the road ahead for peace, security, and human rights’ appropriately reflects our innate and collective desire for peace, security, and human rights. These are the issues that continue to constitute the focus of our national priorities, regional initiatives, and international engagement.
Mr. President,
I am pleased to share with this august Assembly that after about eight years of rigorous democratic exercise conducted in an inclusive, transparent and participatory manner, Nepal promulgated an inclusive democratic constitution, 11 days ago, on 20 September. The promulgation of the constitution endorsed by over 90 percent membership of the 601-member strong Constituent Assembly marks the logical conclusion of the peace process as well as the end of the protracted political transition in the country. It has institutionalized the federal democratic republican system of governance in Nepal. The constitution exemplifies the victory of peace and non-violence as inspired by the teachings of Lord Buddha. It reflects the best of democratic principles, norms and values befitting a country of vast diversity that holds centuries of social harmony and tolerance. The constitution opens up new avenues of empowerment, progress and wellbeing for all disadvantaged groups including women, Tharus, Madhesis, indigenous people, Muslims and dalits with a resolve to create an egalitarian society by ending all discriminations. It guarantees 33% of women representation in the national parliament. I would like to take this opportunity to sincerely thank our neighbors, friends and wellwishers in the international community for their continued support and good wishes received in the course of our historic political transformation.
Mr. President,
Nepal is fully committed to the principles and purposes of the UN Charter. We firmly believe that the United Nations at 70 remains a strong pillar of the international system as well as the institution of hope and trust. The determination of the peoples as well as the  means envisaged for attaining the ends at the time of its founding continues to inspire humanity. The purposes and principles of the UN constitute the solid foundation of international relations. However, a review of the past seven decades of the UN also reveals that much more remains to be done on many fronts, despite several far reaching achievements to its credit. The UN continues to confront numerous challenges in the maintenance of international peace and security as well as in the effective employment of international machinery for the promotion of the economic and social advancement of all peoples.
We, therefore, feel that there is a need for a stronger United Nations that is capable of delivering results based on the wider respect for and observance of the principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity, political independence and non-interference as well as of preserving the universal values of peace, justice, equality, freedom and human dignity. The reforms of the United Nations are needed for strengthening and revitalizing its work to better respond to the increasingly complex and profound challenges. The reforms should be for the promotion of good neighbourly relations; the reforms should contribute towards a smarter maintenance of international peace and security; the reforms should be for the stricter adherence to the principles and purposes of the Charter; the reforms should be to promote economic and social advancement of all peoples; the reforms should be to enhance the dignity of the peoples in a just international order. These are the kind of reforms we advocate, support and aspire for. The reforms should encourage those who can contribute more to the cause of peace and progress. The reforms should instill hope and confidence in those who are marginalized and extend support to those who confront difficult circumstances.
Mr. President,
Nepal has been consistently contributing to the UN peace keeping for about six decades now. More than 120,000 peacekeepers have served so far with distinct professionalism in more than 40 different Missions around the globe and 70 have made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty. As one of the leading troops contributing countries, Nepal remains
steadfast in its commitment to maintaining international peace and security. Loss of lives and injury in the line of duty must be minimized. A strong sense of safety and security of the peacekeepers enhances their confidence and efficiency. We also feel
that leadership opportunities should be given to the member countries commensurate with the contributions to make the best use of their experience and to enhance efficiency and inspire commitment. Given the longstanding contribution and experience both in the field and headquarters, Nepal has the ability and willingness to contribute from senior level leadership positions in the UN peace architecture.
Mr. President,
Nepal fully aligns itself with the spirit of the UN and the international community in dealing with all threats to peace and security. Terrorism is the biggest threat to peace, security, and development. It is shocking to see the emergence of several terrorist outfits including violent extremism and religious fundamentalism in different parts of the globe. We unequivocally condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. As terrorism is a multifaceted problem, its solution demands greater unity, solidarity, and continued and consistent collaborations among the nations to address its root causes. This is best done
under the auspices of the United Nations, and we are in favour of an early conclusion of a Comprehensive Convention on International terrorism.
Nepal stands for general and complete disarmament of all weapons of mass destruction as well as against illicit transfer of small arms and light weapons. Nepal wishes to see the world without weapons and all resources spent on armament urgently diverted to the cause of development for meeting the pressing needs of the people.
We consider the normalization of relations between the US and Cuba as well as the Nuclear deal with Iran to be important indications of forward looking approaches with positive implications for the international peace and security.
Nepal supports the call for a just, lasting and comprehensive peace in the Middle East and to end the conflicts in the region. We recognize the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people for an independent state based on UN resolutions. We recognize the right of every nation in the region to live in peace within secure and recognized international boundaries.
Mr. President,
Since the categorization of the LDCs in 1971, the number of LDCs has grown from 25 to 48. However, only four countries have so far been able to graduate from this status. The rest continue to struggle for development and prosperity. Their struggle has been unfairly long and has also been at the cost of dignity of their people.
An enhanced level of partnership and collaboration is the key to address the challenges. We welcome the Addis Ababa Action Agenda adopted in July this year, the implementation of which will be critical for the success of the new Agenda. We look
forward to a meaningful review of the implementation of Istanbul Programme of Action in 2016.
Similarly, there is a strong need for the effective implementation of the Vienna Programme of Action to make a difference in the lives of about 450 million people living in LLDCs. The world needs to ensure the unhindered access to sea by the LLDCs for free movement of people and goods. We stress that the freedom of transit of LLDCs should not be constrained under any circumstances or pretext to disrupt the flow of goods and services. The freedom of transit of LLDCs must be fully and unconditionally adhered to by all transit countries.
As a country with many of the highest peaks of the world as well as fragile mountains, Nepal is aware of the hardships faced by the mountainous countries. An enhanced level of international collaboration is essential to conserve and promote the mountain
ecosystems for our common benefits. Climate change has emerged as one of the greatest development challenges confronting us. For a least developed country like ours, it increases the cost of development and also compels them to bear disproportionate impacts. There is an urgent need to translate commitments into concrete actions based on the accepted principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, equity and respective capability. A binding international instrument in Paris later this year is a must.
Mr. President,
Human rights, equality and human dignity constitute an integral part of the United Nations’ objectives. We believe in an integrated approach to democracy, development and human rights, and firmly hold the view that democracy is indispensible for development as well as for the enjoyment of political, cultural and social rights as well as the right to development. We underline that the principles of universality, objectivity and non-selectivity must be strictly adhered to. The new constitution promulgated in the country guarantees the fundamental rights of the citizens. It has ambitiously broadened the rights of women, children, elderly and differently able persons as well as marginalized communities.
The issue of refugees is intricately linked with peace, security and human rights, and, therefore, must be addressed with seriousness and priority they deserve. Migration has emerged as a mega-trend. Migrant workers today constitute a significant dimension of the current human mobility. In view of the greater vulnerabilities of such people, due recognition and priority should be given to the protection of their rights and dignity.
Mr. President,
We, in Nepal, have been overwhelmed by the expression of solidarity and cooperation from the international community on an unprecedented scale in the aftermath of the devastating earthquakes that struck Nepal in April and May this year. I would like to take this opportunity to express our sincere appreciation and gratitude to our neighbours, India and China, fellow SAARC members, and all those friends and well-wishers who have so promptly extended their humanitarian support and expressed solidarity with us at the difficult hour and made us feel that we are not alone. We consider the global outpouring of support and solidarity to be an astonishing feat as well as a significant clue to the vast scope and potential of the spirit of the UN. Nepal looks to continued support and solidarity in the phase of rehabilitation and reconstruction.
Mr. President,
The adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development on the historic occasion of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the UN has generated optimism for a better future across the world. The goals to be truly transformative must embrace everyone and must be implemented in their entirety with required resources. For this, guaranteed means of implementation encompassing finance, transfer of technology, capacity and partnership are critical. Many issues of development confronting many countries of the world, particularly the most vulnerable ones, deserve more serious attention if we are to support the cause of peace and security.
We want the United Nations and the international community to turn their immediate attention to the growing inequality, dwindling resources, and existential threat from global warming. Poverty remains a powerful threat to peace, security, and human rights. It acts as the minefield and compounds the woes and sufferings of society. Let us not forget that it is the poor who is constantly exposed to violence, corruption, extortion, and malpractices of the powerful.
I would like to conclude with what B. P. Koirala, first elected Prime Minister of Nepal told the 15th General Assembly, and I quote, “As we look at the world, we find that it is the economic disparity between countries, as between the rich and the poor people within the nation, that is the source of much friction and tension.” Unquote. Economic disparity continues to stare at us all as it was then. Let us commit ourselves to create a sustainable, equitable and inclusive development in larger freedom to address this problem.
I am confident that the spirit of the UN will continue to prevail for the benefit of the humanity in the days to come.
Thank you!
